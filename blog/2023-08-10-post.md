### The Very Important Meeting of Top Officials

INT. LUXURIOUS AUDITORIUM - MORNING

A large projection screen displays an ominous looking solar flare and its projected trajectory towards Earth. Graphs and data points flash on the screen as a voiceover from Orion explains the gravity of the situation.

ORION:
"... and with our current state of preparedness, the effects could be catastrophic."

The camera pans to the audience. Scientists nod seriously, some jotting down notes, but we also see a group of well-dressed, out-of-place individuals - the lobbyists and their allies. One particularly influential lobbyist, MR. Hoffman, subtly checks his watch, uninterested.

As the audience absorbs this, there's the faint ping of a phone notification. The camera briefly cuts to Sophie, who discreetly checks her phone under the table. The screen displays a headline from a popular gossip app: "John Drew's New Tattoo - a Solar Flare? What's the Message? #TrendingNow". Sophie rolls her eyes, quickly silencing the notification.

As the presentation concludes, the lead National Scientist, DR. RAYMOND, stands up.

DR. RAYMOND:
"Thank you, Dr. Orion. We appreciate your... insights. We'll certainly review these findings."

It's evident he's giving a brush-off. Orion senses this but remains hopeful.

ARIA (whispering to Orion):
"They're not taking this seriously."

As the scientists start to disperse, Dr. Raymond is quickly cornered by Mr. Hoffman.

MR. Hoffman (whispering but audible):
"Remember, Ray, this solar nonsense can't disrupt our projects."

DR. RAYMOND (nervously):
"Don't worry, everything's under control."

The camera follows Orion and his team as they exit, expressions ranging from anger to disbelief.

SOPHIE:
"Dad, that didn't go well."

ORION:
"It's just the beginning."

This scene sets the stage for the conflict between genuine scientific concern and corporate/political interests. It introduces our main characters, highlights their primary challenge, and immediately dives into the action.

### "The Concert"

The stadium is packed with pulsating lights, booming music, and throngs of people in a cacophonous mix of excitement and electronic frenzy. Large screens broadcast John Drew's face, his charismatic smile beaming at everyone.

John Drew, shouting to the crowd: "Are you all ready for the most lit concert of the year?!"

The crowd goes wild, screams echoing off the walls.

Sophie, Orion's teenage daughter, walks in, looking around curiously, her face a mixture of excitement and disbelief. She sees people around her, more engrossed in their phones than the live performance in front of them. A girl next to her is recording a selfie, shouting, "Live at John Drew's concert! It's lit!" without even watching the stage.*

The first band, "Gibber Nonsenses," takes the stage. Their lead singer steps up to the microphone and begins.

Lead Singer: "Flibbity jibbity, splickety splack, we're here, we're there, we're everywhere, lack!"

The crowd, inexplicably, erupts in cheer, repeating the nonsensical lyrics and dancing to the odd beats.

Sophie, turning to a nearby attendee: "What did he just say?"

Attendee, without missing a beat: "It's their new hit! Flibbity Jibbity! Don't you know it?!"

Sophie, more to herself: "This is what passes for music these days?"

As the concert progresses, each act is more surreal and superficial than the last. There's a band that just mumbles their entire performance, another that uses odd instruments like squeaky toys and frying pans.

At one point, John Drew returns to the stage for his performance. He starts with a popular song but mid-way switches to singing about the trending words from the spelling bee. The audience, recognizing the words, sings along loudly.

Sophie, texting Orion: "Dad, this is... I don't even know. It's like a parody of itself. Everyone's lost in their screens and meaningless lyrics."

Orion, texting back: "Stay safe, Soph. It's a reflection of our times. We have to change this."

Enter Gemma from the sidelines.

As Sophie tries to process the surreal nature of the concert, Gemma dashes up to her, clad in John Drew merchandise from head to toe – a shirt with his face, glow-in-the-dark wristbands, a cap with "JD" emblazoned on it, and even shoes that light up with every step.

Gemma, almost out of breath: "Oh my gosh, Sophie! Did you see his new merch? It's totally fab! I mean, look at this glow band. It syncs with his songs!"

Sophie, smiling politely: "Yeah, it's...unique."

Gemma, not noticing Sophie's lack of enthusiasm: "And did you hear his latest single? 'Bubbly Trouble'? It's like, sooo deep. I mean, the way he goes 'Bub-bub-bubbly' just resonates with my soul."

Sophie, raising an eyebrow: "Resonates with your soul?"

Gemma: "Yes! And you know what? I have decided. I am going to marry John Drew someday. I mean, we're soulmates. I can feel it."

Sophie, chuckling: "You and the other million girls here."

Gemma, earnestly: "No, seriously, Sophie. When he sang 'Drippy Drop' last summer, I felt like he was speaking directly to me. It's destiny."

Sophie: "Gemma, you're great, but don't you think you're getting a little carried away? I mean, there's a lot more to life than just John Drew and his... interesting music."

Gemma, slightly defensive: "Sophie, you just don't get it. It's like, a spiritual connection."

Sophie: "Alright, alright. You have your spiritual connection, and I'll stick to my physics books."

Gemma: "Your loss! But hey, if I marry him, you're totally getting an invite."

Sophie, laughing: "I'll look forward to that."

They both smile at each other. While the camera focuses on sophie. Slowly, it zooms in in a weird manner as if she senses something is wrong.

### "The Raid"

The setting is a grand auditorium, filled with scientists, scholars, and thinkers from around the world. Charts, diagrams, and holographic models depicting the impending solar flare are on display. Orion and Aria are center-stage, presenting their latest research findings and potential solutions.

Orion, passionately: "This solar flare is unlike anything we've ever encountered. Our traditional measures won't suffice. We must—"

Just then, a loud commotion at the back of the room interrupts him. A throng of frenzied supporters wearing Kalil Drew merchandise, neon paints, and bizarre masks burst into the auditorium, chanting "Drew Power!" and waving signs that say "Nerds No More!"

Aria, bewildered: "What the—?"

Lead Supporter, yelling at the top of his lungs: "You think you can disrespect the Drews? This is for Khalil!"

Chaos ensues. Papers fly, displays are overturned, and the once orderly conference turns into pandemonium. The invaders begin mocking the scientists, mimicking "nerdy" gestures, and snapping selfies amidst the chaos, uploading them with hashtags like #DrewPower and #NerdRaid.

Orion, trying to keep his cool: "We're here to discuss a global crisis, people! Can't you see the gravity of the situation?"

Aria, angrily: "Gravity? They probably think it's a new dance trend!"

Supporter with a Mohawk: "Hey, look at me! I'm a scientist!" He puts on a lab coat and starts doing a silly dance.

Enter sophie, on the side, joining late as she had homework to do.

Orion frustrated at the table. He notices sophie's entrance.
Orion quietly: "You all done with your stuff at school?"
Sophie Nods.

Sophie, having overheard the commotion, steps forward.
Sophie: "Enough! Do you all even understand what's at stake? We're talking about the survival of our planet!"

Gemma, who is part of the Drew horde but recognizes her friend's voice, sheepishly: "Sophie? Is that you?"

Sophie, tears in her eyes: "Yes, Gemma. It's me. Trying to save a world that seems hell-bent on destroying itself."

The Drew supporters slowly begin to quiet down and is momentarily stunned by the figure shouting at them... Eventually the scuttle out as some of them comment about "being bored". The conference is in shambles.

<!-- Orion, somberly: "We'll reconvene tomorrow. Hopefully, in a world that's ready to listen." -->

The scientists and a few Drew supporters help clean up, one of them showing some remorse but not apologising, some of them capitalising on the opportunity to make themselves look like they are cleaning up for "Mistagram".

Sophie and the group depart.

### "The Hearing"

The chamber's ambiance is of stern focus. Tech moguls shift uncomfortably in their chairs under the heavy gaze of Congress members.

Congressman Bill Haley: "It's crucial that we address the pressing concerns of tech censorship and its implications on our society."

Congresswoman Richards: "Thank you, Congressman Haley. Mrs. Nicholson, I have a very serious question regarding your platform's censorship policies."

Kate Nicholson, nervously: "Of course, Congresswoman. Go ahead."

Congresswoman Richards, with a stern tone: "Why are you censoring content related to solar flare preparedness?"

A hushed murmur spreads across the room. Kate clears her throat, preparing to address this grave issue.

Congresswoman Richards, continuing with deep concern: "Because last week, my daughter was not able to upload her solar flare-themed makeup tutorial. This is a travesty! She worked very hard on that look."

There's a moment of stunned silence in the chamber. The weight of her tone completely contradicts the frivolous nature of her complaint.

Congressman Bill Haley, blinking in disbelief: "Congresswoman Richards, with all due respect, today's hearing is meant to address serious issues of censorship that could impact the safety and well-being of our citizens."

Congresswoman Richards, undeterred: "Exactly, Congressman Haley. And makeup is a serious business."

A frantic atmosphere in the courtroom with tense representatives, fidgeting and laughing off quietly at what just happened.

Congressman Bill Haley: "We need to get to the bottom of this. Censorship could have dire consequences for our society."

Congressman Stevens, a friend of Haley but not particularly sharp, leans forward, trying to look confident: "Jason, with the imminent solar flare, how can you justify manipulating information and potentially putting our citizens at risk?"

The room goes silent. Jason visibly pales, eyes darting around as he searches for an answer. Bill Haley smirks, thinking they've cornered the tech representative.

Jason, hesitantly: "Uhh... can I get back to you on that?"

Congressman Stevens, nodding agreeably: "Oh, ok, sure. Whenever you have time."

The opportunity to press the tech mogul slips away. Haley is left open-mouthed, staring in disbelief at Stevens.

Congressman Bill Haley, whispering furiously to Stevens: "What are you doing? We had him!"

Congressman Stevens, shrugging: "I thought I was being polite!"

The scene comes to a close as the speaker declares the end of the hearing. People get up to leave as Bill Haley sits at his seat, stunned.

**"Aftermath in Haley's Office"**

The room is dimly lit, reflecting the heavy mood. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with various political and scientific tomes. Congressman Bill Haley sits at his desk, face buried in his hands, visibly deflated. The door creaks open, and Orion and his group slowly enter.

Orion: "That was... quite something, Congressman."

Bill Haley, looking up with tired eyes: "A circus, Orion. An absolute circus. We have the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, and they're worried about makeup tutorials and app compatibility."

Anna, a member of Orion's group: "It's maddening. We've been trying to raise awareness, but everyone's caught up in their own bubbles."

James, another member: "The public's apathy is fueled by their distractions. We need a different approach, something that shakes them out of their complacency."

Orion: "We've got plans, Bill. Plans to use the very platforms they're obsessed with to spread our message."

Bill Haley, curious: "What do you have in mind?"

Orion: "Well, for starters, we've been working on an AR experience. Something that allows users to see the direct effects of the solar flare on their surroundings."

Anna: "We're also considering a series of viral challenges. Something engaging, fun, but with a clear message about the looming danger."

Bill Haley, smiling for the first time: "That... that might just work. If you can't beat them, join them, right?"

Orion: "Exactly. We fight fire with fire. Or in this case, flare with flare."

Bill Haley: "Let's get to work. Time's running out."

The scene fades with the group huddled around Haley's desk, pouring over plans, models, and devices, showcasing a renewed sense of hope and determination.
