LUXURIOUS AUDITORIUM - MORNING</p><p>A large projection screen displays an ominous looking solar flare and its projected trajectory towards Earth. Graphs and data points flash on the screen as a voiceover from Orion explains the gravity of the situation.</p><p>ORION:
&quot;... and with our current state of preparedness, the effects could be catastrophic.&quot;</p><p>The camera pans to the audience. Scientists nod seriously, some jotting down notes, but we also see a group of well-dressed, out-of-place individuals - the lobbyists and their allies. One particularly influential lobbyist, MR. Hoffman, subtly checks his watch, uninterested.</p><p>As the audience absorbs this, there&#x27;s the faint ping of a phone notification. The camera briefly cuts to Sophie, who discreetly checks her phone under the table. The screen displays a headline from a popular gossip app: &quot;John Drew&#x27;s New Tattoo - a Solar Flare? What&#x27;s the Message? #TrendingNow&quot;. Sophie rolls her eyes, quickly silencing the notification.</p><p>As the presentation concludes, the lead National Scientist, DR. RAYMOND, stands up.</p><p>DR. RAYMOND:
&quot;Thank you, Dr. Orion. We appreciate your... insights. We&#x27;ll certainly review these findings.&quot;</p><p>It&#x27;s evident he&#x27;s giving a brush-off. Orion senses this but remains hopeful.</p><p>ARIA (whispering to Orion):
&quot;They&#x27;re not taking this seriously.&quot;</p><p>As the scientists start to disperse, Dr. Raymond is quickly cornered by Mr. Hoffman.</p><p>MR. Hoffman (whispering but audible):
&quot;Remember, Ray, this solar nonsense can&#x27;t disrupt our projects.&quot;</p><p>DR. RAYMOND (nervously):
&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, everything&#x27;s under control.&quot;</p><p>The camera follows Orion and his team as they exit, expressions ranging from anger to disbelief.</p><p>SOPHIE:
&quot;Dad, that didn&#x27;t go well.&quot;</p><p>ORION:
&quot;It&#x27;s just the beginning.&quot;</p><p>This scene sets the stage for the conflict between genuine scientific concern and corporate/political interests. It introduces our main characters, highlights their primary challenge, and immediately dives into the action.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-concert">&quot;The Concert&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#the-concert" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The stadium is packed with pulsating lights, booming music, and throngs of people in a cacophonous mix of excitement and electronic frenzy. Large screens broadcast John Drew&#x27;s face, his charismatic smile beaming at everyone.</p><p>John Drew, shouting to the crowd: &quot;Are you all ready for the most lit concert of the year?!&quot;</p><p>The crowd goes wild, screams echoing off the walls.</p><p>Sophie, Orion&#x27;s teenage daughter, walks in, looking around curiously, her face a mixture of excitement and disbelief. She sees people around her, more engrossed in their phones than the live performance in front of them. A girl next to her is recording a selfie, shouting, &quot;Live at John Drew&#x27;s concert! It&#x27;s lit!&quot; without even watching the stage.*</p><p>The first band, &quot;Gibber Nonsenses,&quot; takes the stage. Their lead singer steps up to the microphone and begins.</p><p>Lead Singer: &quot;Flibbity jibbity, splickety splack, we&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re there, we&#x27;re everywhere, lack!&quot;</p><p>The crowd, inexplicably, erupts in cheer, repeating the nonsensical lyrics and dancing to the odd beats.</p><p>Sophie, turning to a nearby attendee: &quot;What did he just say?&quot;</p><p>Attendee, without missing a beat: &quot;It&#x27;s their new hit! Flibbity Jibbity! Don&#x27;t you know it?!&quot;</p><p>Sophie, more to herself: &quot;This is what passes for music these days?&quot;</p><p>As the concert progresses, each act is more surreal and superficial than the last. There&#x27;s a band that just mumbles their entire performance, another that uses odd instruments like squeaky toys and frying pans.</p><p>At one point, John Drew returns to the stage for his performance. He starts with a popular song but mid-way switches to singing about the trending words from the spelling bee. The audience, recognizing the words, sings along loudly.</p><p>Sophie, texting Orion: &quot;Dad, this is... I don&#x27;t even know. It&#x27;s like a parody of itself. Everyone&#x27;s lost in their screens and meaningless lyrics.&quot;</p><p>Orion, texting back: &quot;Stay safe, Soph. It&#x27;s a reflection of our times. We have to change this.&quot;</p><p>Enter Gemma from the sidelines.</p><p>As Sophie tries to process the surreal nature of the concert, Gemma dashes up to her, clad in John Drew merchandise from head to toe – a shirt with his face, glow-in-the-dark wristbands, a cap with &quot;JD&quot; emblazoned on it, and even shoes that light up with every step.</p><p>Gemma, almost out of breath: &quot;Oh my gosh, Sophie! Did you see his new merch? It&#x27;s totally fab! I mean, look at this glow band. It syncs with his songs!&quot;</p><p>Sophie, smiling politely: &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s...unique.&quot;</p><p>Gemma, not noticing Sophie&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm: &quot;And did you hear his latest single? &#x27;Bubbly Trouble&#x27;? It&#x27;s like, sooo deep. I mean, the way he goes &#x27;Bub-bub-bubbly&#x27; just resonates with my soul.&quot;</p><p>Sophie, raising an eyebrow: &quot;Resonates with your soul?&quot;</p><p>Gemma: &quot;Yes! And you know what? I have decided. I am going to marry John Drew someday. I mean, we&#x27;re soulmates. I can feel it.&quot;</p><p>Sophie, chuckling: &quot;You and the other million girls here.&quot;</p><p>Gemma, earnestly: &quot;No, seriously, Sophie. When he sang &#x27;Drippy Drop&#x27; last summer, I felt like he was speaking directly to me. It&#x27;s destiny.&quot;</p><p>Sophie: &quot;Gemma, you&#x27;re great, but don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re getting a little carried away? I mean, there&#x27;s a lot more to life than just John Drew and his... interesting music.&quot;</p><p>Gemma, slightly defensive: &quot;Sophie, you just don&#x27;t get it. It&#x27;s like, a spiritual connection.&quot;</p><p>Sophie: &quot;Alright, alright. You have your spiritual connection, and I&#x27;ll stick to my physics books.&quot;</p><p>Gemma: &quot;Your loss! But hey, if I marry him, you&#x27;re totally getting an invite.&quot;</p><p>Sophie, laughing: &quot;I&#x27;ll look forward to that.&quot;</p><p>They both smile at each other. While the camera focuses on sophie. Slowly, it zooms in in a weird manner as if she senses something is wrong.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-raid">&quot;The Raid&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#the-raid" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The setting is a grand auditorium, filled with scientists, scholars, and thinkers from around the world. Charts, diagrams, and holographic models depicting the impending solar flare are on display. Orion and Aria are center-stage, presenting their latest research findings and potential solutions.</p><p>Orion, passionately: &quot;This solar flare is unlike anything we&#x27;ve ever encountered. Our traditional measures won&#x27;t suffice. We must—&quot;</p><p>Just then, a loud commotion at the back of the room interrupts him. A throng of frenzied supporters wearing Kalil Drew merchandise, neon paints, and bizarre masks burst into the auditorium, chanting &quot;Drew Power!&quot; and waving signs that say &quot;Nerds No More!&quot;</p><p>Aria, bewildered: &quot;What the—?&quot;</p><p>Lead Supporter, yelling at the top of his lungs: &quot;You think you can disrespect the Drews? This is for Khalil!&quot;</p><p>Chaos ensues. Papers fly, displays are overturned, and the once orderly conference turns into pandemonium. The invaders begin mocking the scientists, mimicking &quot;nerdy&quot; gestures, and snapping selfies amidst the chaos, uploading them with hashtags like #DrewPower and #NerdRaid.</p><p>Orion, trying to keep his cool: &quot;We&#x27;re here to discuss a global crisis, people! Can&#x27;t you see the gravity of the situation?&quot;</p><p>Aria, angrily: &quot;Gravity? They probably think it&#x27;s a new dance trend!&quot;</p><p>Supporter with a Mohawk: &quot;Hey, look at me! I&#x27;m a scientist!&quot; He puts on a lab coat and starts doing a silly dance.</p><p>Enter sophie, on the side, joining late as she had homework to do.</p><p>Orion frustrated at the table. He notices sophie&#x27;s entrance.
Orion quietly: &quot;You all done with your stuff at school?&quot;
Sophie Nods.</p><p>Sophie, having overheard the commotion, steps forward.
Sophie: &quot;Enough! Do you all even understand what&#x27;s at stake? We&#x27;re talking about the survival of our planet!&quot;</p><p>Gemma, who is part of the Drew horde but recognizes her friend&#x27;s voice, sheepishly: &quot;Sophie? Is that you?&quot;</p><p>Sophie, tears in her eyes: &quot;Yes, Gemma. It&#x27;s me. Trying to save a world that seems hell-bent on destroying itself.&quot;</p><p>The Drew supporters slowly begin to quiet down and is momentarily stunned by the figure shouting at them... Eventually the scuttle out as some of them comment about &quot;being bored&quot;. The conference is in shambles.</p><p>The scientists and a few Drew supporters help clean up, one of them showing some remorse but not apologising, some of them capitalising on the opportunity to make themselves look like they are cleaning up for &quot;Mistagram&quot;.</p><p>Sophie and the group depart.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-hearing">&quot;The Hearing&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hearing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The chamber&#x27;s ambiance is of stern focus. Tech moguls shift uncomfortably in their chairs under the heavy gaze of Congress members.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley: &quot;It&#x27;s crucial that we address the pressing concerns of tech censorship and its implications on our society.&quot;</p><p>Congresswoman Richards: &quot;Thank you, Congressman Haley. Mrs. Nicholson, I have a very serious question regarding your platform&#x27;s censorship policies.&quot;</p><p>Kate Nicholson, nervously: &quot;Of course, Congresswoman. Go ahead.&quot;</p><p>Congresswoman Richards, with a stern tone: &quot;Why are you censoring content related to solar flare preparedness?&quot;</p><p>A hushed murmur spreads across the room. Kate clears her throat, preparing to address this grave issue.</p><p>Congresswoman Richards, continuing with deep concern: &quot;Because last week, my daughter was not able to upload her solar flare-themed makeup tutorial. This is a travesty! She worked very hard on that look.&quot;</p><p>There&#x27;s a moment of stunned silence in the chamber. The weight of her tone completely contradicts the frivolous nature of her complaint.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley, blinking in disbelief: &quot;Congresswoman Richards, with all due respect, today&#x27;s hearing is meant to address serious issues of censorship that could impact the safety and well-being of our citizens.&quot;</p><p>Congresswoman Richards, undeterred: &quot;Exactly, Congressman Haley. And makeup is a serious business.&quot;</p><p>A frantic atmosphere in the courtroom with tense representatives, fidgeting and laughing off quietly at what just happened.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley: &quot;We need to get to the bottom of this. Censorship could have dire consequences for our society.&quot;</p><p>Congressman Stevens, a friend of Haley but not particularly sharp, leans forward, trying to look confident: &quot;Jason, with the imminent solar flare, how can you justify manipulating information and potentially putting our citizens at risk?&quot;</p><p>The room goes silent. Jason visibly pales, eyes darting around as he searches for an answer. Bill Haley smirks, thinking they&#x27;ve cornered the tech representative.</p><p>Jason, hesitantly: &quot;Uhh... can I get back to you on that?&quot;</p><p>Congressman Stevens, nodding agreeably: &quot;Oh, ok, sure. Whenever you have time.&quot;</p><p>The opportunity to press the tech mogul slips away. Haley is left open-mouthed, staring in disbelief at Stevens.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley, whispering furiously to Stevens: &quot;What are you doing? We had him!&quot;</p><p>Congressman Stevens, shrugging: &quot;I thought I was being polite!&quot;</p><p>The scene comes to a close as the speaker declares the end of the hearing. People get up to leave as Bill Haley sits at his seat, stunned.</p><p><strong>&quot;Aftermath in Haley&#x27;s Office&quot;</strong></p><p>The room is dimly lit, reflecting the heavy mood. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with various political and scientific tomes. Congressman Bill Haley sits at his desk, face buried in his hands, visibly deflated. The door creaks open, and Orion and his group slowly enter.</p><p>Orion: &quot;That was... quite something, Congressman.&quot;</p><p>Bill Haley, looking up with tired eyes: &quot;A circus, Orion. An absolute circus. We have the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, and they&#x27;re worried about makeup tutorials and app compatibility.&quot;</p><p>Anna, a member of Orion&#x27;s group: &quot;It&#x27;s maddening. We&#x27;ve been trying to raise awareness, but everyone&#x27;s caught up in their own bubbles.&quot;</p><p>James, another member: &quot;The public&#x27;s apathy is fueled by their distractions. We need a different approach, something that shakes them out of their complacency.&quot;</p><p>Orion: &quot;We&#x27;ve got plans, Bill. Plans to use the very platforms they&#x27;re obsessed with to spread our message.&quot;</p><p>Bill Haley, curious: &quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;</p><p>Orion: &quot;Well, for starters, we&#x27;ve been working on an AR experience. Something that allows users to see the direct effects of the solar flare on their surroundings.&quot;</p><p>Anna: &quot;We&#x27;re also considering a series of viral challenges.

The distances between celestial objects can be very far away, from a few light years to billions.</p><p>Furthermore there can also be a high level of &quot;temporal distance&quot; as the universe seems to be around 13.8 billion years old. Civilisations could have sprung up and gone extinct multiple times or may have even developed so much during such time that they could be comparable to gods. It only took around 10000 years for human civilisations to develop to this extent, where we have relatively useful and powerful technology. And one could wonder what we could end up with given another 10000 years, let alone a million or billion years.</p><p>If string theory were to be true or there are multiple spatial dimensions that objects could move in, perhaps civilisations are able to make use of higher dimensional space and appear almost invisible to us. Furthermore they could be dealing with immense scales of structure and development, like dyson spheres and beyond, and we&#x27;re still trying to find them with much more primitive technology like radio signals and visual data, which they may have already evolved past.</p><p>Other forms of life may also exist but and may be quite prevalent though primitive. In such a case, perhaps it would be harder to detect them. It took relatively long for complex, multicellular life to develop on earth but simple, unicellular life pretty much appeared as soon as the raw materials of water and organic compounds were present in good amounts.</p><p>Perhaps life is highly assymetrical in the universe; either it is very intelligent, or is very primitive.

It is basically a everyone for themselves kind of thing where the talented kids get boosted and the attention while the others that might different skill sets are generally just placed there to conform to the standards set. It does not allow an expansion of one&#x27;s creativity from young and lead to a natural curiosity and interest in subjects like mathematics, science, history, etc. Teachers are burdened with 20-30 kids each and have to stay in a room for 8 hours a day. It just seems so inefficient. Think about the times when you actually get interested in something, you might spend hours on end by yourself, researching the task, reading books, writing notes. It almost happens automatically. You dont need to be coerced at all. Yet it seems we are led to be believe the best course of action is to have an &quot;industrial&quot; process of &quot;kids in, kids out&quot;, where its like a factory line from &quot;grade 1 to 12&quot;. Where kids sit down all day, having to look forward and listen for the most part. Sure there may be some interesting dynamics, mostly dependent on the teacher themselves, like perhaps encouraging discussion, giving out creative assignments, engaging with students a bit more at an individual level. But I think as a whole, it just feels quite inefficient and places too much &quot;structure&quot; on kids from young without them exploring these fields in a naturally curious way themselves</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/06/25/update">Theory of Natural Intelligence</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-06-25T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 25, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I think I have come up with an interesting theory of intelligence. It basically divides &quot;intelligence&quot; into two major aspects in terms of learning, cognition</p><ol><li>capacity</li><li>performance</li></ol><p>and another aspect: need.</p><p>Humans have a very high capacity for learning and can learn deep, complex rules and facts. Like, the nature of weather, what causes wind, what causes death. Animals like whales also seem quite intelligent but do not have the same level of complexity in their neocortex, i.e. they may not have as much &quot;grey matter&quot; in proportion to their white matter</p><p>Human intelligence is also quite performant in terms of reasoning, arithmetic, planning and creativity. You can think about many different scenarios and consider many different factors when planning. And its usually quite decent, depending your current mental state. Sometimes its faster, sometimes its slower. Perhaps due to cognitive load and anxiety, or a lack of stimulus. Humans, when given the right stimulus and foundational knowledge, are capable of many things compared to other animals.</p><p>Creativity could be an aspect of &quot;capacity&quot;, like when you have to find a workaround to solve an issue and so you leverage your existing knowledge base to identify a different concept that could be potentially applied to the problem.</p><p>Performance also implies how fast you can learn something and how much you can leverage your existing knowledge  BASE to aid your reasoning and understanding of a subject.</p><p>But that does not necessarily mean that humans have a &quot;need&quot; to do something or create something. You do not always need to think about e.g. what happened at the beginning of the big bang, or whats on the other side of the moon. You dont have to reinvent the wheel either, you could use other people&#x27;s knowledge and works. Nor do you have to completely understand how it works deep down, just how to interface with it. Much of human understanding seems to have derived from individuals seeking out knowledge and understanding of concepts and things we face everyday. Instead of just treating them like black boxes. For example, the human body is very complex, and for a long time, it was not known how such bodily processes worked exactly. Perhaps some general details, but things like pathogens and microorganisms were all around us yet were not discovered until somewhat recently during the scientific revolution.</p><p>Creativity could be also be an aspect of &quot;need&quot;. In the finding a workaround example, perhaps you are pressured by e.g. your boss to finish your job by the end of today. Using traditional methods, it would take too long. So you have a strong incentive to perhaps increase the performance of your brain to think about concepts more abstractly, and potentially find another alternative. In humans, this might e.g. engage your right brain hemisphere more, which may have evolved to process abstract thought.</p><p>What this also means that while an octopus or whale could potentially have pretty high performance and capacity for complex thought, planning and learning. But they may not have the right incentives to push them to leverage their intelligence like the way humans have in terms of building civilisations.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/05/22/update">Well, Damn</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-05-22T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 22, 2023</time> · <!-- -->7 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I cleaned up this space a bit recently. Many things have happened since then. I think I let my uninformed imagination get to me quite often and its hard to know when your just making up some random stuff in your mind or when you actually stumbled upon something significant. The CSTC circuits and gut-brain axis can make humans do some stupid things, whether that be getting too tense or anxious about some random stuff or freezing them in place, repeating such a cycle.</p><p>And AI. Well guess my predictions came to be true. GPT really is becoming the new thing everyone will not stop talking about. Whether that be scientists, the ignorant masses or scammers.</p><p>I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going to happen anymore, I feel quite conflicted and chaotic. My mind never ceases to bring up some bizzare  thought. Its like the more I do what I do, the less I feel like I really know anything at all. Like Im trying to become so open minded, considering all the possible timelines, technologies, cases, reasons for things happening that my brains have fallen out.</p><p>Persistent data structures? Functional programming? Dataflow programming? Logic programming? Proofs? Concurrency? Metaprogramming through metaobjects? Macros? Procedural programming?</p><p>Haskell? Scala? Clojure? Racket? Idris? APL? Rust? Pharo? Prolog? Mercury? Julia? Python? Elixir? Erlang? ATS?
All such languages have their pros and cons, especially on the current hardware-software landscape. Many were developed to work with existing APIs or ways of thinking. I think research languages like haskell and coq are better in this regard, so as languages like APL and smalltalk. With regard to intergration with existing interfaces and simplicity, python takes the cake, and perhaps julia too. Many tools are built using python, like APT.</p><p>I don&#x27;t know what I even want either. I feel like I get quite nervous sometimes when coding and Im unable to do something that would be usually quite straightforward, even something as simple as reading the error messages from compilation with langs like haskell. That being said having easier interfaces would probably quite beneficial. Mojo might be a decent language if it gets released... apparently its quite fast and fixes some of python&#x27;s issues.</p><p>I think I want something like python and haskell with rust level static analysis and safety. The simplicity and expressiveness when coding in python feels unmatched. Perhaps its also because I feel more familiar with it, like rust. But Im also quite familiar with C, C++, and JS but I dont really feel like those are as good to write in and I make frequent mistakes in them. Having optional types might be a big factor. As well as a single interface to write collections in. Whether that be specifications like a struct or an array of values or a combination. I think idris does particularly well in that regard.</p><p>I also want to be able to match on simple maths logic like <code>x - y &gt; 0</code> on a single arm like:</p><div class="language-rust codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-rust codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">match x, y</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    case x - y &gt; 0 =&gt; ...</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">// in addition to</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">match x, y</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    case (1, 0) =&gt; ...</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Scala&#x27;s unapply is also quite cool, I haven&#x27;t made much use of it but I feel like this way of thinking is quite ingenious (I think haskell has it too).</p><div class="language-scala codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-scala codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">AddOne:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    x: _</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    y: _</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    match: (x, y) =&gt; Self(x+1, y+1)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Im not quite sure how I feel about smalltalk&#x27;s metaobject and everything is an object thing. I dont see much of a reason to add methods at runtime, but checking what methods you do have could be useful. That would add to the runtime storage overhead but ehh. Apparently it could be quite useful to modify the method definition at runtime if there&#x27;s a bug or something. Maybe attach a remote debugger and tell the VM to change the object&#x27;s method. Kind of like self modifying code as well I guess. It could be quite useful for security and pushing new features, but I have yet to see it in practice. In theory you could push out an updated method to all running instances quite trivially, without having to recompile or restart the system. Combined with a very simple, resilient hardware system, it could be a very potent method of running programs.</p><p>Im also not quite sure about logic programming. On one hand, it seems quite powerful and concise in terms of representing classes of problems related to knowledge bases and queries. On the other hand, I dont really think its better than functional programming implementations like haskell at writing up complex logic for dealing with lists. I think an observation here is being able to easily express logic to deal with multi dimensional arrays. Python isnt too bad at it, but the syntax can be a bit confusing when people use <code>arr[1, 2]</code> or when you have many dimensions and you have to keep track of what dimension it is in. Perhaps something like <code>rust-analyser</code> could help here with its automatic annotations, which could be applied to tensor accesses statically or dynamically. Maybe something like an <code>ith</code> dimension, and the server is smart enough to detect a shortening of the dimensions for example to <code>i-1</code>.</p><p>Im not sure about proofs. It seems like you can pretty much prove everything, though the turing decidability problem is a limiting factor. So you could have something where you are able to prove 99% your functions terminate and even &quot;statically&quot; evaluate calls if they wont take up too much space. And decompose functions from a complex form to a simple form. Maybe through graph theory or HoTT. I heard its possible, through generating different, simpler functions and testing that against the original. Paired with randomised algorithms, the sky looks blue. Dependent types are also often talked about in proofs, and is a key component it seems, at least if you want static proofs. Theres total functional programming which actually seems quite good too, but if I will sacrifice expressiveness for it, then nevermind. It seems like the gist of most proof languages involve annotating down a function to ensure that the recursive case eventually reaches the base case through e.g. decrementing the required value at each step. There can not be any steps where you might or might not return a value, you must do so, and that value must get you strictly closer to your goal by some non-zero amount.</p><p>Verification is another thing. I haven&#x27;t tried out a verification tool yet so I dont really know how to make of it. Some say its a waste of time. Some say its only good for things you want to not fail under any circumstances, like a plane&#x27;s software or a hospital. I think I should look into it some more, but if your model or spec is flawed, wouldnt your software be too?</p><p>Performance. Ive looked a bunch of articles and like... damn. Performance seems very hard to get right in the current software-hardware landscape. Whether that be through compiler optimisation, syscall optimisation, algorithmic optimisation, adding more potent hardware, faster and more memory, etc. On the compiler optimisation front, you have tons of ways to make a program potentially faster, often at the cost of more memory usage (time-space tradeoff). Sometimes though it could be as simple as removing redundant instructions and memory accesses, or batching them together. Maybe prefetching too, but tbh I haven&#x27;t seen it been used myself, though I think LLVM should insert them (it goes against lazy evaluation though I think). I also dont even think high performance is that much of a problem. Rather its more like consistent, good enough performance. I would much rather play a game on a consistent 30 fps than having FPS spikes and valleys from 40-80fps even though the latter has a higher average fps. I also dont pay attention to variable resolution as long as its not too big of a gap, which means the flow of content is probably much more important than its sharpness or detail.</p><p>To that end, on the consistent performance front, it might be good to start off with a lazy language and a deterministic set of hardware and low level interfaces. The scheduler could possibly use a randomised algorithm though, which can be a bit ironic but my intuition tells me it could work out quite well.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2022/11/21/update">Update</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-11-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 21, 2022</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="archived-posts">Archived Posts<a class="hash-link" href="#archived-posts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Any post older than this is a rough collection of my thoughts.
