Those will be optional. What I dont want is types I think, that would definitely make it less prolog-like.</p><p>If not using the cut operator, maybe prolog predicates could be mapped to SAT problems relatively simply.
If so, external high performance SAT solvers could be used.</p><ol><li>Parallelism using lightweight greenthreads and maybe a userspace threading library could help.
Like it could basically identity independent parts of the program and aggressively try to parallelise them.
Too fine grained, probably not good. Especially considering the processors we use right now.</li></ol><p>Per-Goal Basis: Parallelizing on a per-goal basis could be a promising approach. Each goal in Prolog can be considered a reasonably self-contained unit of computation, making it a good candidate for parallel execution. Maybe do dependency analysis on each goal beforehand to see if you can parallelize it &quot;embarrassingly&quot; or might require extra synchronization.</p><p>Lists and collections could potentially be parallelized at a very fine level of granularity in terms of vectorized instructions.
One could annotate that a list of N elements of integers could be represented as say a list of N 32-bit integers, and be represented in a tightly packed array that could be easily amenable for vector operations like vector addition.</p><p>Could complicate backtracking quite a bit. Might require synchronization.</p><p>Biggest issue is I think the fact that modern processors are kind of setup for coarse grained parallelism, on a per-process basis.</p><ol start="2"><li>More efficient backtracking. Not sure what it might look like. Maybe some hueristics and things to make searching potentially more optimal.</li></ol><p>Backjumping and Learning: Instead of traditional backtracking, use techniques like backjumping, where the system jumps back more than one level in the search tree when a dead end is reached. Learning from failed paths to avoid similar paths in the future can also be efficient.</p><p>Heuristic methods can be very effective but require domain-specific knowledge.</p><ol start="3"><li>Maybe type inference where possible. By assigning concrete types, just in time to queries, it could make the code more lightweight if we can map the values to primitive data types like 32-bit integers rather than abstract objects.</li></ol><p>How to do this? It feels like some cases could be easier and straightforward while other cases harder. The general plan is to be able to map complex prolog data and values to low level primitives.</p><div class="language-pl codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-pl codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% what is T? in normal prolog, it would just be a generic type</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% but we can infer from the use of T in t(T)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">x(T) :- t(T).</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% t is defined here as 1 and &quot;x&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% that means statically we can say that t(T) where T = union(num, string)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% since we are only given a value = 1 for num, we can further optimize and say num = int8</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% x is also a single string, and we could turn that into an vector of 1-byte each to represent ASCII because we dont need UTF-8 encoding</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% we could also choose to further optimize string down to a single char rather than a vector or array, since we are only given a string with 1 element</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">t(1).</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">t(&#x27;x&#x27;).</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>In this example, we can apply type inference based on the original data available.

Does that mean we should then recompile our initial program to change the type signature and the way that <code>t(T)</code> and all the predicates that depend on it work?</p><p>Version it, and recompile. Maybe not even version if we dont want, but can easily also redo it or use the existing predicate and only recompile on demand if the new version actually should get used.</p><p>Maybe we can mark it as dirty. Then use the dynamically typed version while it is recompiling. The shell could show something like <code>(detected new type... recompiling)</code>.</p><ol start="4"><li>Ad hoc optimizations.</li></ol><p>Maybe we could optimize on the fly based on the types of queries we receive.</p><ol start="5"><li>Memory Management</li></ol><p>Maybe using linear types or uniqueness types a la rust could be useful for memory management. Since we are basically threading data into goals, we could dont have to make copies of the data each time.</p><p><strong>Linear types</strong>, <strong>CPS</strong> and <strong>primitive data type inference</strong> could all be useful for reducing memory load and increasing cache efficiency.</p><p>Maybe more aggressive tabling, and tabling by default.</p><ol start="6"><li>Semantics Changes</li></ol><p>Maybe instead of treating predicates like function calls with stack frames. We instead use a continuation passing style where we are always threading the caller context through to the next caller, so that it can return if need be. We basically pass the current continuation to the next.</p><p>But will probably still use stack frames for keeping track of local memory, unless we dont create more data.</p><p>Hybrid Approach: CPS could be used selectively for performance-critical parts of the code, while keeping traditional stack-based execution for other parts.</p><ol start="7"><li>Concurrency Features at Hardware Level</li></ol><p>Generally cores right next to each other in the processor TOPOLOGY can much more quickly communicate with each other, by factors of 10x. Its already not too bad, like 20ns to 100ns. But it might be hard to directly schedule threads that are topology aware, generally the OS&#x27;s job since it exposes a thread API.</p><ol start="8"><li>Spatial and Temporal Optimizations</li></ol><p>Tightly packing collections into say an array like structure or struct of arrays could be quite cogent.
Maybe try to use hueristics to invoke a goal that would be physically and temporally close to goals that already exist.</p><p>Specialized data structures.</p><ol start="9"><li>More Extreme Considerations</li></ol><p>Maybe GPUs and tensor processsing hardware could be used instead. It might add more latency, but could be highly effective for workloads where it is more about searching and simple computations than sequential execution.</p><p>Parallel Search and Pattern Matching: Prolog&#x27;s search and pattern matching operations, which are often highly parallelizable, could greatly benefit from GPU acceleration. GPUs, with their thousands of small cores, are adept at handling such massively parallel computations.</p><p>Data-Intensive Operations on large sets of data, especially those that involve simple, repeatable computations (like processing lists or arrays), can be significantly sped up on GPUs.</p><p>Standard vs. Accelerated Predicates: Offer both standard predicates like <code>maplist</code> for CPU execution and specialized versions like <code>maplist_accel</code> for GPU-accelerated execution. This allows the programmer to explicitly choose the acceleration for computationally intensive tasks.</p><p>Use Julia for interop and calling external things, not C, or C but ensure that it is very portable.
Or compile the julia program to C and link that. Probably going to have to use julia to interact with LLVM.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="syntax">Syntax<a class="hash-link" href="#syntax" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I also think it could be an opportunity to potentially improve the syntax in an optional manner. Like you can also make it use a whitespace sensitive approach where you dont have to use <code>,</code> to compose statements in CONJUNCTION. And instead of <code>predicate(Args...)</code>, use <code>predicate Args...</code> in certain contexts like elixir.</p><p>With whitespace sensitivity, the <code>.</code> period could also be omitted in some contexts.</p><p>I think having higher order predicates like <code>P1(P2(Args...))</code> where P1 and P2 are parameters is also a must. Maybe builtin lambda functions too, but Im not sure, that might make it not work very well with existing implementations. Maybe just the <code>yall</code> library in SWI-Prolog is good enough, prolog is not a functional programming language.</p><p>So this would be valid</p><div class="language-prolog codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-prolog codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ancestor X Y :- father X Z, father Z Y</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">%% or</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ancestor X Y :-</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  father X Z</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  father Z Y</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-existing-prolog-implementations-do-their-thing">How do existing Prolog implementations do their thing?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-existing-prolog-implementations-do-their-thing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Many implementations use the WAM as a basis. The original implementation based on (I think cambridge or some other english university) was designed by David Warren and kind of worked quite well. It was quite powerful in terms of what it could do, its features. I think it wasnt the greatest in performance, but was good enough for many things like AI and databases and searching/planning.</p><p>SWI-Prolog, made by Jan Wielemaker is probably the most widely used and developed version. It supports ISO Prolog to large extent, though not sure if its fully compliant. I&#x27;ve read some of its source code and it looks decent for a program that was started a while back. It beats other open source implementations in performance by quite a bit, modern and old alike: scryer-prolog, eclipse prolog, etc. I heard good things about scryer-prolog too, but last I checked its benchmarks were okay-ish but not as competitive as SWI.</p><p>Then theres SICSTus, probably the gold standard in high performance prolog. It seems to use a combination of JIT compilation and hueristics to achieve pretty high performance. By almost an order of magnitude or two compared to SWI sometimes. It probably also does type inference and some complex memory representation and management. Maybe some complex and efficient backtracking too. It does compile to native code, probably something it made itself as it is quite a bit old now (I dont think it uses LLVM, though maybe newer versions might). JIT does incur some initial latency and therefore time penalties but can more than make up for it when it gets going. Things like cranelift for WASM could also speed up JIT compilation, and a WASM runtime to allow near native performance in many cases (or so Ive heard, probably should look more into it).</p><p>I noticed in many prolog implementations, there is also a lot of checking. A lot of checking between executions. It might have been fine back then to make sure it actually works, but the checking Im talking about are things like just seeing whether or not an operation succeeded. I think if we want high performance, we really do need to minimize dynamic checks where possible. Maybe type inference could help with that, and dynamic types otherwise rather than a cursed mix of static-ish operations on a virtual machine.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/09/15/meta-computer">Metacomputer</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 15, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The metacomputer is a general type of computer. It is at its most general form, a &quot;thing&quot; that can &quot;usefully&quot; &quot;process&quot; a &quot;chunk of symbols&quot; representing &quot;rules&quot; according to a &quot;chunk of rules&quot;.</p><p>What does process mean? It means to be able to manipulate the symbols (both rules and data) in some way. It means to be able to change those symbols. Now, if you went like &quot;sleep 5&quot;, would that then still be considered a computation? Or maybe a lack of computation? If declared explicitly, then it should be considered a functionality. If a system was waiting for a piece of computation because of e.g. queuing or setbacks, then that probably should not be considered a computation.</p><p>Functionalities are the basis for things to be done on a metacomputer. They generalise and batch rules together to create complex things like sorting algorithms, games, etc.</p><p>Data-Functionality relationship. All functionality can be seen as just another form of data. Aka some chunk of symbols. But instead of its more neutral properties associated with any other chunk of data, a functionality could be seen as a chunk of symbols that can be interpeted differently or directly by the metacomputer.</p><p>Rules. Rules are the atomic &quot;things&quot; that a metacomputer uses to do &quot;useful&quot; things. A rule could simply just be, add 1 to a number. Thereby interpreting a symbol as a number and adding 1 to it. The instruction or symbol(s) that back the rule itself can also be interpreted, by other rules. A primitive metacomputer could have something like a program counter which allows it to automatically process available rules. It could be called a &quot;program basis&quot; that basically generalises the notion of fetching from some store and allocating something to handle it.</p><p>A program basis in a hypothetical metacomputer could involve several sets of sub basis&#x27;. Like maybe you could have a global syncer and a bunch of local instruction counters or whatnot. Or a dispatcher or scheduler.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/09/07/antarctican-english">Antarctican English</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-09-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 7, 2023</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Alphabet. probably based on a modification of the latin alphabet with upper and lowercase characters

This is for Khalil!!&quot;</p><p>Chaos ensues as the raiders run over the place, tipping over tables and pushing and shoving scientists and themselves. Some people trip over themselves. Papers fly, displays are overturned. The invaders begin mocking the scientists, mimicking gestures like correcting ones glasses and snapping selfies of themselves with lab coats, with Nerd emojis and uploading the pictures with the hashtag #DrewPower.</p><p>Orion (trying to keep his cool): &quot;We&#x27;re here to discuss a global crisis, people! Can you all not see the gravity of <em>this</em> situation?&quot;</p><p><strong>ARIA</strong>: &quot;Gravity? They probably think it&#x27;s a new dance trend!&quot;</p><p>Supporter with a Mohawk: &quot;Hey, look at me! I&#x27;m a scientist!&quot; He puts on a lab coat and starts doing a silly dance.</p><p>Enter sophie, on the side, joining late as she had homework to do.</p><p>Orion frustrated at the table.

Trying to save a world that seems hell-bent on destroying itself.&quot;</p><p>The Drew supporters are momentarily stunned by the figure shouting at them but go back to shouting and acting like fools... Eventually they scuttle out of the conference as some of them comment about &quot;being bored&quot;. The conference is in shambles.</p><p>The scientists and a few Drew supporters help clean up, one of them showing some remorse but not apologising, some of them capitalising on the opportunity to make themselves look like they are cleaning up for &quot;Mistagram&quot;.</p><p>Sophie and the group depart.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-hearing">&quot;The Hearing&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hearing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The chamber&#x27;s ambiance is of stern focus. Representatives of several big technology and energy companies shift uncomfortably in their chairs under the heavy gaze of Congress members.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley: &quot;It&#x27;s crucial that we address the pressing concerns of tech censorship and its implications on our society.&quot;</p><p>Congresswoman Richards: &quot;Thank you, Congressman Haley. Mrs. Nicholson, I have a very serious question regarding your platform&#x27;s censorship policies.&quot;</p><p>Kate Nicholson (nervously): &quot;Of course, Congresswoman. Go ahead.&quot;</p><p>Congresswoman Richards (with a stern tone): &quot;Why are you censoring content related to solar flare preparedness?&quot;</p><p>A hushed murmur spreads across the room. Kate clears her throat, preparing to address this grave issue.</p><p>Congresswoman Richards: &quot;Because last week, my daughter was not able to upload her solar flare-themed makeup tutorial. This is a travesty! She worked very hard on that look.&quot;</p><p>There&#x27;s a moment of stunned silence in the chamber before members start to nod at each other in seeming agreement as if the congresswoman made a good point.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley (blinking): &quot;Congresswoman Richards, with all due respect, today&#x27;s hearing is meant to address serious issues of censorship that could impact the safety and well-being of our citizens.&quot;</p><p>Congresswoman Richards: &quot;Exactly, Mr Haley. And makeup is a serious business.&quot;</p><p>The members again, turn towards each other and their respective party members and nod in seeming agreement at a good point.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley: &quot;...We need to get to the bottom of this. Censorship could have dire consequences for our society.&quot;</p><p><strong>Congressman Stevens</strong> (leans forward, trying to look confident): &quot;Representative of ChiEnergy - Jason was it, with the imminent solar flare, how can you justify manipulating information and potentially putting our citizens at risk?&quot;</p><p>The room goes silent. Jason visibly pales, eyes darting to his colleagues as they quietly whisper something to each other. Bill Haley smirks, thinking they&#x27;ve cornered the tech representative.</p><p>Jason (hesitantly): &quot;I dont have the full details as of now, so uhh... can I get back to you on that?&quot;</p><p>Congressman Stevens (nodding agreeably): &quot;Oh, ok, sure. Whenever you have time.&quot;</p><p>The opportunity to press the tech mogul slips away. Haley is left open-mouthed, staring in disbelief at Stevens.</p><p>Congressman Bill Haley (whispering furiously to Stevens): &quot;What are you doing? We had him!&quot;</p><p>Congressman Stevens (shrugging): &quot;I thought I was being polite!&quot;</p><p>The scene comes to a close as the speaker declares the end of the hearing. People get up to leave as Bill Haley sits at his seat, stunned.</p><p><strong>&quot;Aftermath in Haley&#x27;s Office&quot;</strong></p><p>The room is dimly lit, reflecting the heavy mood. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with various political and scientific tomes. Congressman Bill Haley sits at his desk, face buried in his hands, visibly deflated. The door creaks open, and Orion and his group slowly enter.</p><p>Orion: &quot;That was... quite something, Congressman.&quot;</p><p>Bill Haley, looking up with tired eyes: &quot;A circus, Orion. An absolute circus. We have the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, and they&#x27;re worried about makeup tutorials and... app compatibility.&quot;</p><p>Anna: &quot;It&#x27;s maddening. We&#x27;ve been trying to raise awareness, but everyone&#x27;s caught up in their own bubbles.&quot;</p><p>James: &quot;The public&#x27;s apathy is fueled by their distractions. We need a different approach, something that shakes them out of their complacency.&quot;</p><p>Orion: &quot;We&#x27;ve got plans, Bill. Plans to use the very platforms they&#x27;re obsessed with to spread our message.&quot;</p><p>Bill Haley, curious: &quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;</p><p>Orion: &quot;Well, for starters, we&#x27;ve been working on an AR experience. Something that allows users to see the direct effects of the solar flare on their surroundings.&quot;</p><p>Anna: &quot;We&#x27;re also considering a series of viral challenges. Something engaging, fun, but with a clear message about the looming danger.&quot;</p><p>Bill Haley, smiling for the first time: &quot;That... that might just work. If you can&#x27;t beat them, join them, right?&quot;</p><p>Orion: &quot;Exactly. We fight fire with fire. Or in this case, flare with flare.&quot;</p><p>Bill Haley: &quot;Let&#x27;s get to work. Time&#x27;s running out.&quot;</p><p>The scene fades with the group huddled around Haley&#x27;s desk, pouring over plans, models, and devices.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="space">&quot;Space&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#space" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Enter the science team.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/09/Arkology">Arkology</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 9, 2023</time> · <!-- -->27 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="writers">Writers<a class="hash-link" href="#writers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Jason Qin

With an umbrella held in one hand, she begins to speak, her voice passionate yet calm.</em></p><p><strong>Jessie</strong>: &quot;People of this town! Do you not feel the weight of the heavens above? The tears that flow endlessly?&quot;</p><p>A curious murmur goes through the crowd. A few nod, some exchange glances, others appear skeptical.</p><p><strong>Young boy</strong>, looking up at his mother: &quot;Mama, why does she talk about the rain like it&#x27;s something new?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mother, whispering</strong>: &quot;Shh, just listen.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jessie</strong>, continuing: &quot;It&#x27;s not just the sky that weeps. Our very souls are drenched, seeking shelter, seeking answers. I come from Nazareth, a place many of you might not have heard of. But I bring a message of faith.&quot;</p><p><strong>Skeptical man</strong>, nudging his friend: &quot;Nazareth? Sounds fancier than this place.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jessie</strong>, ignoring the comment, passionately: &quot;All we need is to have faith! Faith will be our refuge from this endless storm. Believe, and you will find solace.&quot;</p><p>As she speaks, a few in the crowd appear visibly moved, others intrigued, and some maintain their skepticism. A hushed conversation begins amongst the townspeople.</p><p><strong>Jessie</strong>, pointing to the sky: &quot;Look above, and see not just rain, but a sign! A sign that asks us to reflect, to change, to believe!&quot;</p><p>As her speech draws to a close, a group of people move closer, eager to know more about this faith Jessie speaks of. Others drift away, pondering her words, while a few shake their heads dismissively.</p><p><strong>Young girl</strong>, looking up at her father: &quot;Daddy, should we believe her?&quot;</p><p><strong>Father</strong>, thoughtfully: &quot;Well, pumpkin, everyone has to find their own umbrella in this rain.&quot;</p><p>The scene ends with Jessie talking to a small group, her message spreading, and the town abuzz with conversations about the mysterious woman from Nazareth.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-sky">The Sky<a class="hash-link" href="#the-sky" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><em>Open with a long shot of Jessie standing in the midst of an eager crowd, her voice rising above the din. Her charisma and passion draw more and more people in, as they hang onto every word she speaks.</em>
<em>Around her, a community is forming. Makeshift tents, crafted from anything waterproof, are erected. Some have patterns resembling temples, while others look more like haphazard shelters.</em></p><p><em>In one corner, a group sits in a circle, playing instruments. The rhythmic beats of their drums, combined with the rain&#x27;s cadence, creates a haunting melody. People join in, dancing and swaying to the music. The atmosphere is both solemn and celebratory.</em>
<em>The smell of food wafts through the air. Vendors sell hot soups and bread, trying to make the best out of the situation. There&#x27;s laughter, singing, and a palpable sense of unity.</em></p><p><em>Camera cuts to a child, playing by the side. She&#x27;s maneuvering a small wooden boat through a puddle, engrossed in her own world. She looks up, distracted by the singing, and turns to her mother.</em></p><p><strong>Child:</strong> &quot;Mama, why are they singing?&quot;</p><p><em>The mother, her face etched with lines of worry, crouches down to her child&#x27;s level. She gently wipes rain and stray hair from her daughter&#x27;s face. Looking up at the gray sky, then back at her daughter, she smiles softly.</em></p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> &quot;They&#x27;re asking the sky to stop crying, dear.&quot;
<em>The child looks up, her innocent eyes trying to fathom the enormity of the situation. She places her toy boat on the water and watches as it floats away.</em></p><p><strong>Child:</strong> (whispering) &quot;I wish the sky would listen.&quot;</p><p><em>The mother pulls her child close, holding her tightly, providing warmth and comfort.

The glow of countless candles illuminates the faithful, their faces showing a mixture of hope, desperation, and determination. Soft chants and prayers can be heard. A close-up of an old man&#x27;s face, his eyes closed and lips moving silently in prayer. Beads of sweat or perhaps rain, mixed with tears, trace lines on his wrinkled face. His hands clutch a religious relic.</em></p><p>Suddenly, a chill runs up the old man&#x27;s spine. He feels something cold and wet touch his feet. He slowly opens his eyes and looks down, horrified to see water slowly creeping in, darkening the stone floor of the temple.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> (Voice trembling) &quot;The temple&#x27;s flooding!&quot;</p><p><em>A collective gasp goes through the crowd. Panic ensues. People scramble, picking up their belongings and their young ones.

The divine is testing our resolve! We must stand strong!&quot;</p><p><em>A mother clutches her child, her face pale. Nearby, a young man helps an elderly woman to her feet, preparing to evacuate.

<em>The camera pans up, capturing the ever-present, dark storm clouds that blanket the city, casting everything in a gloomy shade.</em>
…</p><p><em>Shots of city residents getting down to practical solutions. Children and adults alike are seen piling sandbags, creating barricades, and innovating ways to live in a city that&#x27;s slowly turning into a canal town.</em></p><p><strong>Teenager</strong>, building a makeshift raft: &quot;Enough of this praying nonsense! I&#x27;m going sailing!&quot;</p><p><em>Inside Jessie&#x27;s base – a dark, damp room.

A deep rumble. The tower starts to shake.
Panicking visitors rush towards the exit.

The distances between celestial objects can be very far away, from a few light years to billions.</p><p>Furthermore there can also be a high level of &quot;temporal distance&quot; as the universe seems to be around 13.8 billion years old. Civilisations could have sprung up and gone extinct multiple times or may have even developed so much during such time that they could be comparable to gods. It only took around 10000 years for human civilisations to develop to this extent, where we have relatively useful and powerful technology. And one could wonder what we could end up with given another 10000 years, let alone a million or billion years.</p><p>If string theory were to be true or there are multiple spatial dimensions that objects could move in, perhaps civilisations are able to make use of higher dimensional space and appear almost invisible to us. Furthermore they could be dealing with immense scales of structure and development, like dyson spheres and beyond, and we&#x27;re still trying to find them with much more primitive technology like radio signals and visual data, which they may have already evolved past.</p><p>Other forms of life may also exist but and may be quite prevalent though primitive. In such a case, perhaps it would be harder to detect them. It took relatively long for complex, multicellular life to develop on earth but simple, unicellular life pretty much appeared as soon as the raw materials of water and organic compounds were present in good amounts.</p><p>Perhaps life is highly assymetrical in the universe; either it is very intelligent, or is very primitive. If they are very intelligent, they could already have transcended the usual lifestyles and universal laws we deal with. If they are very primitive, they might not have as much of an impact on their planet and is harder to detect from distances away.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/07/19/early-education">Culture Surrounding Early Education</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 19, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I think the culture that kids are brought up in does not naturally lead to enlightenment and effective growth. It is basically a everyone for themselves kind of thing where the talented kids get boosted and the attention while the others that might different skill sets are generally just placed there to conform to the standards set. It does not allow an expansion of one&#x27;s creativity from young and lead to a natural curiosity and interest in subjects like mathematics, science, history, etc. Teachers are burdened with 20-30 kids each and have to stay in a room for 8 hours a day. It just seems so inefficient. Think about the times when you actually get interested in something, you might spend hours on end by yourself, researching the task, reading books, writing notes. It almost happens automatically. You dont need to be coerced at all. Yet it seems we are led to be believe the best course of action is to have an &quot;industrial&quot; process of &quot;kids in, kids out&quot;, where its like a factory line from &quot;grade 1 to 12&quot;. Where kids sit down all day, having to look forward and listen for the most part. Sure there may be some interesting dynamics, mostly dependent on the teacher themselves, like perhaps encouraging discussion, giving out creative assignments, engaging with students a bit more at an individual level. But I think as a whole, it just feels quite inefficient and places too much &quot;structure&quot; on kids from young without them exploring these fields in a naturally curious way themselves</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
