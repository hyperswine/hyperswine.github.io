Where the hell do I begin...

Been quite ... busy for the last few years. Busily wasting time I guess.
Looked at a bunch of stuff.
Practiced a few things here and there but also not really.
Overall feels like that I could definitely practice more but should not constrain myself
Not really using Mind half the time, just autopilot
Just allowing past to seep in half the time to haunt
