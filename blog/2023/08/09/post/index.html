The camera pans over a cityscape with buildings half-submerged in water. The persistent drizzle is ever-present. The clock tower in the distance reads 7:00 AM.</em></p><p><em>Cut to the inside of a cozy-looking bedroom. An alarm clock rings. A hand sluggishly reaches out to silence it. The camera shows the face of a middle-aged woman, <strong>SARAH</strong>, slowly waking up.</em></p><p><strong>SARAH</strong>, yawning: &quot;Another rainy day...&quot;
<em>She rises, stretching and heads to the window. Pulling aside the curtains, she&#x27;s greeted by the sight of children in raincoats, boats navigating what used to be streets, and vendors selling waterproof goods.</em></p><p><strong>*SARAH</strong> begins her routine, moving to the bathroom. She tries to brush her teeth, but the sink is overflowing. Sighing, she uses a cupped hand to catch rainwater from a leak in the ceiling instead.*</p><p><strong>SARAH</strong>: &quot;Who needs plumbing anymore?&quot;</p><p><em>Moving to the kitchen, she attempts to make coffee, but as she&#x27;s about to pour it, a sudden gust of wind blows her kitchen window open. Rainwater splashes all over her breakfast.</em></p><p><strong>SARAH</strong>: &quot;Of course...&quot;
<em>She salvages what she can, placing a bowl strategically under another leak to catch water for her coffee. She reads half-heartedly while wringing out her soaked newspaper.</em></p><p>NEWSPAPER: &quot;And in today&#x27;s forecast, ahh rain! Yes thats right folks, it should be raining today, with an almost 100% chance, <em>or</em> maybe 99.99%, cant be too sure these days. Residents are advised to—&quot;</p><p><em>A deafening crash interrupts the broadcast. <strong>SARAH</strong>&#x27;s ceiling, weakened from the constant moisture, caves in. Debris, rain, and fragments of the roof pour into her living room.</em></p><p><strong>SARAH</strong>, in disbelief: &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me...&quot;
<em>Neighbors rush to help, some sympathizing but watching from afar.

Something to keep the family busy.&quot;</p><p><strong>GARY</strong>, chuckling: &quot;In this weather, I imagine a lot of folks have taken up carpentry. What kind of wood you looking for?&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>, scratching his head: &quot;Sturdy. Something that&#x27;ll hold up against... well, you know.&quot;</p><p><strong>GARY</strong>, nodding towards the rain outside: &quot;Ah.. Cypress or cedar might be your best bet. They&#x27;re water-resistant. As for nails, you&#x27;ll want the rust-proof ones.&quot;</p><p><strong>GARY</strong> looks at <strong>NOAH</strong> in a half interested manner albeit a bit suspiciously as well, like someone had just walked in and asked for a bunch of things</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>: &quot;Sounds good. I&#x27;ll take as much as you&#x27;ve got.&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>: &quot;Just got a bit of a &quot;shed&quot; going along, I guess, ahah&quot;
<strong>GARY</strong> nods.</p><p><strong>GARY</strong>: &quot;Right. Well, best of luck with that. Let me know if you need anything for your shed.&quot;

Yeah. I suppose the wind ain&#x27;t ripping my raincoat off. But it sure is ripping my &#x27;shed&#x27; off&quot;
Customer: &quot;Ah that right…&quot;
Customer, chuckling: &quot;Well, with the way things have been going, maybe we all should be building our own &#x27;sheds&#x27;.&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>, forcing a smile: &quot;Maybe we should. Everyone could use a little shelter from the storm.&quot;</p><p>Customer, tapping <strong>NOAH</strong>&#x27;s shoulder playfully: &quot;Or from life&#x27;s many storms. Take care and good luck with your &#x27;project&#x27;.&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong> with a semi genuine and grateful tone: &quot;Thanks. You too. Stay dry out there.&quot;
Customer, chuckling lightly: &quot;Haven&#x27;t been dry in years!&quot;</p><p>As <strong>NOAH</strong> moves on, he overhears snippets of conversations from other customers discussing their own struggles with the weather and how they&#x27;ve been adapting, one chuckling to themselves and laughing at the other&#x27;s expense as the other says that god will punish them for laughing at him</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="after-school">After School<a class="hash-link" href="#after-school" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;<strong>RILEY</strong>, you got a moment this afternoon?

Later, at cafe 2</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;Remember when we used to complain about the heat?&quot;</p><p><strong>RILEY</strong>: &quot;what? uhh well yea I guess&quot;</p><p><strong>RILEY</strong>: &quot;though I got to say, its gotten quite a lot more humid&quot;</p><p><strong>RILEY</strong>: &quot;mosquitoes bothering you too?&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;yea yea, they sure do.

It&#x27;s been years, <strong>RILEY</strong>. I can&#x27;t even remember the last time we saw the sun. And it&#x27;s like nobody really cares or... or like we&#x27;ve all just accepted this never-ending downpour as our fate.&quot;</p><p><strong>RILEY</strong>, leaning back and looking out the window: &quot;Maybe that&#x27;s just it. Maybe it&#x27;s easier to accept and adapt than to hope and get disappointed. I mean, what can we really do?&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>, frustrated: &quot;But that&#x27;s just it! I feel like there&#x27;s this... weight, y&#x27;know? Like we&#x27;re all waiting for something to happen, something to change. But no one&#x27;s taking any steps to actually make it happen.&quot;</p><p><strong>RILEY</strong>, looking directly at <strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;So what do you propose? Keep trying with the ark thing that keeps falling apart? Set out to find where the rain ends? Or just sit in cafes, complain and do nothing?&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>, looking a bit taken aback: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, man. Maybe we could... I don&#x27;t know... try to understand it. Maybe there&#x27;s a reason, or a solution. I just feel like there&#x27;s got to be more than this.&quot;</p><p><strong>RILEY</strong>, softer now: &quot;Maybe there is, <strong>JACK</strong>. Maybe there is. But until we figure that out, we&#x27;ve got our rain boots, umbrellas, and each other, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>, smiling weakly: &quot;Yeah.

He shakes off his umbrella and hangs up his raincoat, splattering water everywhere. He looks around, a hint of amusement in his eyes.</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;You know, someone once told me that the rain is God&#x27;s tears. Do you believe in that sort of thing?&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong> doesn&#x27;t look up right away, just continues scribbling and calculating. After a beat, he lets out a dry chuckle.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>: &quot;God&#x27;s tears, huh... If that&#x27;s the case, I reckon even He&#x27;s getting weary of crying by now.&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong> smirks, taking a closer look at the formulas and sketches strewn across the table.</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;What are you working on? Some kind of solution to this eternal downpour?&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>: (Sighs) &quot;Trying to. Every time I think I&#x27;ve got it figured out, something goes wrong. It&#x27;s like solving a puzzle with constantly changing pieces.&quot;</p><p>Suddenly, a big droplet from the leaky ceiling lands right on one of the papers <strong>NOAH</strong> was working on, smearing the ink. <strong>NOAH</strong>&#x27;s face tightens in frustration.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>: &quot;Darn it!&quot; He wipes away at his sweat, but more drops continue to fall, threatening the other papers. &quot;Still got all of these to do.&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you take a break? It&#x27;s late, and you look exhausted.&quot;</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong>: (Rubs his temples) &quot;I wish I could, but time&#x27;s running out.

Well, sort of. It harnesses the power of rain, converting the kinetic energy of raindrops into electrical energy.&quot;</p><p>Student 2: &quot;Seems... complicated.&quot;</p><p><strong>LEONARD</strong>: &quot;Ah, but that&#x27;s the beauty of it! All these rains and no one&#x27;s thought to harness its power. Until now!&quot;</p><p><strong>LEONARD</strong> reaches out and flicks a switch. The spinning wheel starts to turn rapidly, and lights begin to blink. The contraption hums loudly, causing some students to cover their ears.</p><p>Student 3: &quot;It&#x27;s... loud.&quot;</p><p><strong>LEONARD</strong>: &quot;A small price to pay for innovation, young man! Imagine powering an entire city with just raindrops.&quot;</p><p><strong>JACK</strong>: &quot;But, what happens when it doesn&#x27;t rain?&quot;</p><p><strong>LEONARD</strong>: &quot;Oh, we haven&#x27;t had to worry about that for years. The forecast is always on my side!&quot;</p><p>Suddenly, there&#x27;s a loud pop, followed by a small puff of smoke. The lights go out, and the wheel stops turning.

Believe, and you will find solace.&quot;</p><p>As she speaks, a few in the crowd appear visibly moved, others intrigued, and some maintain their skepticism. A hushed conversation begins amongst the townspeople.</p><p><strong>Jessie</strong>, pointing to the sky: &quot;Look above, and see not just rain, but a sign! A sign that asks us to reflect, to change, to believe!&quot;</p><p>As her speech draws to a close, a group of people move closer, eager to know more about this faith Jessie speaks of.

<em>Around her, a community is forming. Makeshift tents, crafted from anything waterproof, are erected. Some have patterns resembling temples, while others look more like haphazard shelters.</em></p><p><em>In one corner, a group sits in a circle, playing instruments. The rhythmic beats of their drums, combined with the rain&#x27;s cadence, creates a haunting melody. People join in, dancing and swaying to the music. The atmosphere is both solemn and celebratory.</em>

The glow of countless candles illuminates the faithful, their faces showing a mixture of hope, desperation, and determination. Soft chants and prayers can be heard. A close-up of an old man&#x27;s face, his eyes closed and lips moving silently in prayer. Beads of sweat or perhaps rain, mixed with tears, trace lines on his wrinkled face. His hands clutch a religious relic.</em></p><p>Suddenly, a chill runs up the old man&#x27;s spine. He feels something cold and wet touch his feet. He slowly opens his eyes and looks down, horrified to see water slowly creeping in, darkening the stone floor of the temple.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong> (Voice trembling) &quot;The temple&#x27;s flooding!&quot;</p><p><em>A collective gasp goes through the crowd.

The divine is testing our resolve! We must stand strong!&quot;</p><p><em>A mother clutches her child, her face pale. Nearby, a young man helps an elderly woman to her feet, preparing to evacuate.
