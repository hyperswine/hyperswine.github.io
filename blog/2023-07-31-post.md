title: Assymetric Distribution of Life in the Universe
---

Ive thought about the drake equation and the fermi paradox quite a bit and kinda came to a view that perhaps there really isnt a paradox or problem with why we dont see aliens. The distances between celestial objects can be very far away, from a few light years to billions.

Furthermore there can also be a high level of "temporal distance" as the universe seems to be around 13.8 billion years old. Civilisations could have sprung up and gone extinct multiple times or may have even developed so much during such time that they could be comparable to gods. It only took around 10000 years for human civilisations to develop to this extent, where we have relatively useful and powerful technology. And one could wonder what we could end up with given another 10000 years, let alone a million or billion years.

If string theory were to be true or there are multiple spatial dimensions that objects could move in, perhaps civilisations are able to make use of higher dimensional space and appear almost invisible to us. Furthermore they could be dealing with immense scales of structure and development, like dyson spheres and beyond, and we're still trying to find them with much more primitive technology like radio signals and visual data, which they may have already evolved past.

Other forms of life may also exist but and may be quite prevalent though primitive. In such a case, perhaps it would be harder to detect them. It took relatively long for complex, multicellular life to develop on earth but simple, unicellular life pretty much appeared as soon as the raw materials of water and organic compounds were present in good amounts.

Perhaps life is highly assymetrical in the universe; either it is very intelligent, or is very primitive. If they are very intelligent, they could already have transcended the usual lifestyles and universal laws we deal with. If they are very primitive, they might not have as much of an impact on their planet and is harder to detect from distances away.
