### Archived Posts

Any post older than this is a rough collection of my thoughts. You can just forget they even exist.

### A new page

I'll try to make newer posts higher quality and actually ending somewhere. With a list of edits at the bottom.

Its also getting close to the first iteration I think. For neutron on star64.

### Feeling Terrible, as always

Uhh yea...

I take my anger out on others due to the anger taken out on me by other others. And they take it back out on me. The cycle keeps continuing.

My mental state is always fluctuating. The shame and guilt and everything keeps driving me mad.

It also keeps me going forward perhaps. Well maybe.

I think a lot of my current anxiety stems from social aspects and how I feel like I may be perceived by others. I would often instinctely act in suboptimal ways. Im embarrassed to have to think of others potentially judging me or making "extreme" facial reactions or gestures at me. I remember someone just saying "...ok?". To me it was kind of rude. Just take my word for it, Im not like you lowly idiots. I dont want to have to lie or do your little cultural bullshittery to get my way. I like science and consider myself a scientist.
