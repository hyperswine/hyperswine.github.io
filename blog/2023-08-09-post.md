_The scene begins with a gentle, rhythmic sound of droplets, a soft lo-fi tune playing in the background. The camera pans over a cityscape with buildings half-submerged in water. The persistent drizzle is ever-present. The clock tower in the distance reads 7:00 AM._

_Cut to the inside of a cozy-looking bedroom. An alarm clock rings. A hand sluggishly reaches out to silence it. The camera shows the face of a middle-aged woman, Sarah, slowly waking up._

Sarah, yawning: "Another rainy day..."
_She rises, stretching and heads to the window. Pulling aside the curtains, she's greeted by the sight of children in raincoats, boats navigating what used to be streets, and vendors selling waterproof goods._
_Sarah begins her routine, moving to the bathroom. She tries to brush her teeth, but the sink is overflowing. Sighing, she uses a cupped hand to catch rainwater from a leak in the ceiling instead._
Sarah: "Who needs plumbing anymore?"

_Moving to the kitchen, she attempts to make coffee, but as she's about to pour it, a sudden gust of wind blows her kitchen window open. Rainwater splashes all over her breakfast._
Sarah: "Of course..."
_She salvages what she can, placing a bowl strategically under another leak to catch water for her coffee. The radio in the background reports yet another storm warning. She listens half-heartedly while wringing out her soaked newspaper._
Radio Announcer: "And in today's forecast, ahh rain! Yes thats right folks, it should be raining today, with an almost 100% chance, *or* maybe 99.99%, cant be too sure these days. Residents are advised to—"

_A deafening crash interrupts the broadcast. Sarah's ceiling, weakened from the constant moisture, caves in. Debris, rain, and fragments of the roof pour into her living room._
Sarah, in disbelief: "Oh, you've got to be kidding me..."
_Neighbors rush to help, some sympathizing but watching from afar. A kid floats by on an inflatable ring, waving cheerfully._
Kid: "Looks like you've got an indoor pool now, Mrs. Sarah!"
Sarah, trying to muster a smile: "Always looking for a home upgrade."

_The scene ends with Sarah, surrounded by her chaotic living room, holding her coffee cup up to catch the rain directly, signaling her reluctant acceptance of the new norm._

...

Noah, in the marketplace, looking for building materials and wood.
Child, looking at a floating toy boat: "Mama, can we sail tomorrow?"
Mother, holding an umbrella over them: "Every day's a sailing day now, love."
Noah, overhears, pretends not to notice and proceeds to go inside a hardware store called "Gary's Hardware Store"
Noah glanced at a middle aged looking guy that looks like he's in charge of the place, with "Gary" on his tag: "Hey, Im looking for some wood, nails, and uhh.."

Gary, looking Noah up and down: "Building something big, are we?"
Noah, trying to be discreet: "Just a... project. Something to keep the family busy."
Gary, chuckling: "In this weather, I imagine a lot of folks have taken up carpentry. What kind of wood you looking for?"
Noah, scratching his head: "Sturdy. Something that'll hold up against... well, you know."
Gary, nodding towards the rain outside: "Ah.. Cypress or cedar might be your best bet. They're water-resistant. As for nails, you'll want the rust-proof ones."
Gary looks at noah in a half interested manner albeit a bit suspiciously as well, like someone had just walked in and asked for a bunch of things
Noah: "Sounds good. I'll take as much as you've got."
Noah: "Just got a bit of a "shed" going along, I guess, ahah"
Gary nods.
Gary: "Right. Well, best of luck with that. Let me know if you need anything for your shed."
Noah nods and hurries along.
A customer notes Noah's anxious demeanor and chuckles pleasantly, "Its such a good day today, its a shame it seems you got a lot on your plate"
Noah: "Uhh. Yeah. I suppose the wind ain't ripping my raincoat off. But it sure is ripping my 'shed' off"
Customer: "Ah that right…"
Customer, chuckling: "Well, with the way things have been going, maybe we all should be building our own 'sheds'."
Noah, forcing a smile: "Maybe we should. Everyone could use a little shelter from the storm."
Customer, tapping Noah's shoulder playfully: "Or from life's many storms. Take care and good luck with your 'project'."
Noah with a semi genuine and grateful tone: "Thanks. You too. Stay dry out there."
Customer, chuckling lightly: "Haven't been dry in years!"

As Noah moves on, he overhears snippets of conversations from other customers discussing their own struggles with the weather and how they've been adapting, one chuckling to themselves and laughing at the other's expense as the other says that god will punish them for laughing at him

…

Jack: "Riley, you got a moment this afternoon? I kinda had something on my mind"
Riley: "something going on man?"
Jack: "Just… come". Jack turns his back to leave, waving a sign "2" back at riley
Later, at cafe 2

Jack: "Remember when we used to complain about the heat?"
Riley: "what? uhh well yea I guess"
Riley: "though I got to say, its gotten quite a lot more humid"
Riley: "mosquitoes bothering you too?"
Jack: "yea yea, they sure do. But listen..."
Jack: "You think all of this is normal? I mean. The way everyone's acting and all. Like, I dont really know how to say it but.."

Riley, sipping his drink and looking thoughtful: "You mean how everyone's just... going on with life, like it's just another rainy day?"
Jack, hesitating: "Yeah, exactly. It's been years, Riley. I can't even remember the last time we saw the sun. And it's like nobody really cares or... or like we've all just accepted this never-ending downpour as our fate."
Riley, leaning back and looking out the window: "Maybe that's just it. Maybe it's easier to accept and adapt than to hope and get disappointed. I mean, what can we really do?"
Jack, frustrated: "But that's just it! I feel like there's this... weight, y'know? Like we're all waiting for something to happen, something to change. But no one's taking any steps to actually make it happen."
Riley, looking directly at Jack: "So what do you propose? Keep trying with the ark thing that keeps falling apart? Set out to find where the rain ends? Or just sit in cafes, complain and do nothing?"
Jack, looking a bit taken aback: "I don't know, man. Maybe we could... I don't know... try to understand it. Maybe there's a reason, or a solution. I just feel like there's got to be more than this."
Riley, softer now: "Maybe there is, Jack. Maybe there is. But until we figure that out, we've got our rain boots, umbrellas, and each other, right?"
Jack, smiling weakly: "Yeah. Until the next raindrop falls."

…

_Scene opens with a soft pitter-patter of rain hitting the roof. Noah is hunched over a desk, papers scattered about, and a small lantern providing dim light. His shirt is clinging to his back, wet either from the rain or sweat, or maybe both._

Jack (or a visitor) steps into the room, having just come in from outside. He shakes off his umbrella and hangs up his raincoat, splattering water everywhere. He looks around, a hint of amusement in his eyes.
**Jack:** "You know, someone once told me that the rain is God's tears. Do you believe in that sort of thing?"
Noah doesn't look up right away, just continues scribbling and calculating. After a beat, he lets out a dry chuckle.
**Noah:** "God's tears, huh... If that's the case, I reckon even He's getting weary of crying by now."
Jack smirks, taking a closer look at the formulas and sketches strewn across the table.

**Jack:** "What are you working on? Some kind of solution to this eternal downpour?"
**Noah:** (Sighs) "Trying to. Every time I think I've got it figured out, something goes wrong. It's like solving a puzzle with constantly changing pieces."

Suddenly, a big droplet from the leaky ceiling lands right on one of the papers Noah was working on, smearing the ink. Noah's face tightens in frustration.
**Noah:** "Darn it!" He wipes away at his sweat, but more drops continue to fall, threatening the other papers. "Still got all of these to do."
**Jack:** "Why don't you take a break? It's late, and you look exhausted."
**Noah:** (Rubs his temples) "I wish I could, but time's running out. The city can't take much more of this."
Jack, feeling a bit helpless, tries to offer some comfort.

**Jack:** "Hey, we'll figure it out. We always do. And if not today, then... maybe tomorrow or something."
**Noah:** (Smiles weakly) "Thanks, Jack. I appreciate the optimism."
As Jack nods and starts to leave the room, Noah goes back to his work, but not before taking a deep breath and looking out of the window, where the relentless rain continues its dance.

…

The sky is a uniform grey, the rain persistent but not torrential. Townspeople move about their day in water-resistant clothing, umbrellas bobbing up and down like a sea of moving mushrooms. Small puddles have formed, children occasionally jumping into them, giggling. There's the muted sound of rain tapping on various surfaces, the main background music to everyday life.

Amidst the chatter, a group begins to gather near a statue in the middle of the square. As more people gather, the curious onlookers form a semi-circle. In the center stands Jessie.
She's an enigmatic figure, her clothes a mix of vibrant colors which stand out starkly against the prevailing grey. With an umbrella held in one hand, she begins to speak, her voice passionate yet calm.

Jessie: "People of this town! Do you not feel the weight of the heavens above? The tears that flow endlessly?"
A curious murmur goes through the crowd. A few nod, some exchange glances, others appear skeptical.
Young boy, looking up at his mother: "Mama, why does she talk about the rain like it's something new?"
Mother, whispering: "Shh, just listen."
Jessie, continuing: "It's not just the sky that weeps. Our very souls are drenched, seeking shelter, seeking answers. I come from Nazareth, a place many of you might not have heard of. But I bring a message of faith."
Skeptical man, nudging his friend: "Nazareth? Sounds fancier than this place."
Jessie, ignoring the comment, passionately: "All we need is to have faith! Faith will be our refuge from this endless storm. Believe, and you will find solace."

As she speaks, a few in the crowd appear visibly moved, others intrigued, and some maintain their skepticism. A hushed conversation begins amongst the townspeople.
Jessie, pointing to the sky: "Look above, and see not just rain, but a sign! A sign that asks us to reflect, to change, to believe!"
As her speech draws to a close, a group of people move closer, eager to know more about this faith Jessie speaks of. Others drift away, pondering her words, while a few shake their heads dismissively.

Young girl, looking up at her father: "Daddy, should we believe her?"
Father, thoughtfully: "Well, pumpkin, everyone has to find their own umbrella in this rain."
The scene ends with Jessie talking to a small group, her message spreading, and the town abuzz with conversations about the mysterious woman from Nazareth.
…

_Open with a long shot of Jessie standing in the midst of an eager crowd, her voice rising above the din. Her charisma and passion draw more and more people in, as they hang onto every word she speaks._
_Around her, a community is forming. Makeshift tents, crafted from anything waterproof, are erected. Some have patterns resembling temples, while others look more like haphazard shelters._

_In one corner, a group sits in a circle, playing instruments. The rhythmic beats of their drums, combined with the rain's cadence, creates a haunting melody. People join in, dancing and swaying to the music. The atmosphere is both solemn and celebratory._
_The smell of food wafts through the air. Vendors sell hot soups and bread, trying to make the best out of the situation. There's laughter, singing, and a palpable sense of unity._

_Camera cuts to a child, playing by the side. She's maneuvering a small wooden boat through a puddle, engrossed in her own world. She looks up, distracted by the singing, and turns to her mother._
**Child:** "Mama, why are they singing?"
_The mother, her face etched with lines of worry, crouches down to her child's level. She gently wipes rain and stray hair from her daughter's face. Looking up at the gray sky, then back at her daughter, she smiles softly._
**Mother:** "They're asking the sky to stop crying, dear."
_The child looks up, her innocent eyes trying to fathom the enormity of the situation. She places her toy boat on the water and watches as it floats away._
**Child:** (whispering) "I wish the sky would listen."

_The mother pulls her child close, holding her tightly, providing warmth and comfort. The camera pans upwards, capturing the vastness of the sky, the relentless rain, and the sea of people below, all united in hope and prayer._
…

_Open with an aerial shot of the city, raindrops hitting the camera lens. The rhythmic sound of rain envelops everything. We get an almost melancholic view of a city drowning both literally and metaphorically._

_Cut to a dimly lit temple. The glow of countless candles illuminates the faithful, their faces showing a mixture of hope, desperation, and determination. Soft chants and prayers can be heard._
_A close-up of an old man's face, his eyes closed and lips moving silently in prayer. Beads of sweat or perhaps rain, mixed with tears, trace lines on his wrinkled face. His hands clutch a religious relic._

Suddenly, a chill runs up his spine. He feels something cold and wet touch his feet. He slowly opens his eyes and looks down, horrified to see water slowly creeping in, darkening the stone floor of the temple.

**Old Man:** (Voice trembling) "The temple's flooding!"

_A collective gasp goes through the crowd. Panic ensues. People scramble, picking up their belongings and their young ones. The water level rises steadily, soaking the hem of robes and snuffing out the candles one by one._

**Priest:** (Desperately trying to maintain calm) "Keep your faith! The divine is testing our resolve! We must stand strong!"
_A mother clutches her child, her face pale. Nearby, a young man helps an elderly woman to her feet, preparing to evacuate. The temple bell rings, its sound echoing ominously._

_Cut to the outside. The streets are turning into canals. People wade through knee-deep water, holding their possessions above their heads. Vendors try to save their goods, and children splash around, trying to find moments of joy in the chaos._
_In the distance, the silhouette of the grand tower can be seen, a beacon of hope or perhaps a symbol of humanity's hubris._
_The camera pans up, capturing the ever-present, dark storm clouds that blanket the city, casting everything in a gloomy shade._
…

_Shots of city residents getting down to practical solutions. Children and adults alike are seen piling sandbags, creating barricades, and innovating ways to live in a city that's slowly turning into a canal town._
Teenager, building a makeshift raft: "Enough of this praying nonsense! I'm going sailing!"
_Inside Jessie's base – a dark, damp room. A single candle flickers, revealing coughing followers, their faith clearly shaken._
Follower 1, voice trembling: "Jessie, how much longer?"
Jessie, attempting to be confident: "Hold on to your faith! Just a little longer."
Follower 2, breaking down: "This is madness! We're drowning while waiting for a miracle."

_The scene culminates in a powerful moment where a once-faithful member stands up, confronting Jessie._
Follower 3, enraged: "We've been duped! This isn't faith. This is suicide!"

…

The scene opens with Jack, sitting alone on a partially submerged bench, rain pouring, his raincoat’s hood shadowing his eyes. The town below has water creeping up, with lanterns and floating devices shining like stars. A half-submerged school or library in the distance, its ancient and steampunk-infused architecture evident.

Beside him is a wet history book, pages soaked and some fluttering with the breeze. As Jack traces a finger on a depiction of the Ice Age, the next page shows early humans innovating – creating fire, crafting tools, and clothing themselves.

He then looks towards the water, where he notices fish swimming gracefully, their scales reflecting lantern lights, moving effortlessly with the current. In stark contrast, on the other side, farm animals are stranded, their hooves deep in mud, some being herded onto floating platforms by townspeople.

Jack, murmuring to himself: "Change... it’s relentless, unforgiving."
He looks at the fish again.
Jack: "But it's not biased. It's not punishing us. It’s just... change."

Suddenly, there’s a splash nearby. A little girl is trying to rescue a stranded kitten from a floating crate. Jack instinctively moves to help, and together, they place the kitten safely on higher ground.
Little girl, looking gratefully at Jack: "It's a hard world for little things."
Jack, looking at the saved kitten, then back at the water: "Maybe. But every hard world has its survivors. The trick is to adapt, to learn... like our ancestors did."
The little girl nods and runs off with her kitten, leaving Jack to his contemplation.

He picks up his soaked book, and as water drips from its pages, Jack seems more resolved.
Jack, to himself: "Just as they wrote their history during the Ice Age, we'll write ours in this... Rain Age. Through innovation, unity, and resilience."
The scene ends with Jack standing, looking at the Ark in the distance, then back at the town, a newfound determination in his eyes.

Scene Notes
* **Scene Start:** As Jack sits on the bench, the rain's intensity grows slightly, echoing his internal turmoil. The sound of raindrops on his raincoat, the wet pages of the book, and the distant muffled sounds of the town, combine to create a sense of solitude.
* **Little Girl & Kitten:** The sound becomes more focused, the distant white noise receding, making their interaction intimate and forefront.
* **Post Interaction:** As the girl leaves, the distorted sound of rain, comes to the fore. This white noise symbolizes the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts inside Jack's mind. It's almost deafening, representing his inner conflict and struggle for clarity.
* **Revelation:** As Jack comes to his realization, the white noise starts to fade, replaced by a gentle, inspirational score that begins to swell, capturing his acceptance and newfound determination. The rain remains but becomes softer, backgrounded, allowing Jack's internal shift to take center stage.

Jack might chuckle to himself as the scene fades out and away...


…

_Setting:_ A vast construction site buzzing with activity. Workers scurry about, while others are trying to pour what appears to be a grayish, sloppy mixture into molds.

Close-up of a worker's hands smoothing the "concrete." He looks hopeful.
Time-lapse: The concrete doesn’t set; instead, it becomes a muddy puddle. Workers’ expressions shift from hopeful to exasperated.
Boss shouts, "Why isn't this setting?!"
Worker: "Maybe the rain’s giving it too much of a drink, boss!" Others chuckle.
Boss, rubbing his temples: "Alright, what about rocks? Good ol’ fashioned rocks?"
Another worker, sarcastically: "Ah yes, the cutting-edge technology of... rocks."

_Setting:_ The stone tower, looming high, with banners and balloons. A big sign reads: "GRAND OPENING!"

Families, children, couples, all lining up, tickets in hand.
Vendor hawking mini replica towers: "Get your piece of history!"
Another vendor selling “Tower Tacos”.
A grumpy-looking cashier points at a sign that reads: "Cash ONLY. No rainchecks."
People at the top of the tower, taking in the view, posing for sketches (camera alternative).

_Setting:_ Atop the tower. Panoramic view of the sprawling city below. It’s breathtaking, but the inundated areas speak to the impending disaster.

Noah, visibly moved, gazes out. The gravity of the situation weighs on him.
A deep rumble. The tower starts to shake.
Panicking visitors rush towards the exit.
Noah, gripping the tower’s edge, looks down. We see cracks appearing.

_Setting:_ Ground level. Rubble everywhere. Dust clouds. People coughing and helping each other up.

A distraught woman holds up a broken replica tower: "I just bought this!"
A vendor quickly sets up a stall with "I Survived the Tower" T-shirts.
Officials confront the boss: "This was a disaster waiting to happen!"
Boss, defensively: "Look, my nephew assured me he followed all the safety protocols..."
Official, incredulously: "Your nephew?!"

_Setting:_ Inside the Ark. Noah in the foreground, animals and his family behind.

Noah, earnestly: "That tower... it was the pinnacle of our hubris..."
In the background, a stack of crates wobbles and falls, mimicking the tower's collapse, as animals scurry.
Noah, oblivious to the chaos, continues his reflective monologue.

…

_Wide shot of the city. The rhythmic thudding of boots grows louder. Out of the misty curtain of rain emerges an impressive line of soldiers. They're perfectly coordinated, with their polished helmets gleaming in the rare glimpses of sunlight. A brass band at the forefront plays a triumphant hymn reminiscent of "Rule, Britannia"._ "Hmm hmm hm-hm-hmhmhmh hmm hmm.. hm.. hmm" a citizen hummed along without caring to notice the soldiers arriving in town...
_The citizens look on with a mixture of awe and bemusement. Some kids giggle, pointing at the soldiers' sopping wet uniforms and how the rain is making their proud flags droop._

_The army comes to a stop in front of the "Cafe 2". The hymn continues._
Soldier 1 (whispering to Soldier 2): "Finally, a break. My feet are soaked!"
Soldier 2: "Tell me about it. Trench foot's a real concern. At least it's consistent everywhere, from the trenches to the towns."
Soldier 3, overhearing: "Remember when the worst we complained about was the heat?"
Soldier 4: "Now it's the endless downpour. Just once, I'd like to see the sun without getting wet."

_Meanwhile, the brass band is still energetically playing the hymn, oblivious to the rest._
Commander, looking increasingly agitated: "Alright, that's enough!"
_The band doesn't seem to hear him over their own music._
Commander, louder: "I said, ENOUGH!"
_The band still continues. The Commander's face turns red._

Commander, screaming at the top of his lungs: "ARGH, STOP WITH THAT ALREADY! WE'VE HEARD THAT STUFF FOR LIKE 5 HOURS!"
_The hymn abruptly stops, replaced by the persistent patter of rain. The band members sheepishly put down their instruments._
Drummer, muttering: "Thought it set a good mood..."
Commander, massaging his temples: "Just...go get a coffee. And someone find me a dry pair of socks."

_As the army scatters to find shelter and warmth in the cafe, the scene fades with a few townsfolk chuckling and imitating the marching of the bedraggled soldiers._

…

_Scene opens to Noah, standing atop a ladder, hammer and nail in hand, attempting to fix a leak on the ark. He looks focused, the rain pouring down around him. The leak is right above a sign that humorously reads, “Ark 2.0 – Now with Fewer Leaks!”_

Noah, talking to himself: "Alright, just one more nail should do the trick..."
_As he hammers the nail, another leak sprouts two feet away. He sighs deeply, looking comically exasperated._
Noah: "Why can't it just... hold for once?"

_A bird flies by, perching on the edge of the ark. It chirps cheerfully, seemingly mocking Noah._
Noah, glaring at the bird: "You think this is funny?"
_The bird poops, missing Noah by an inch. He sighs again._
Noah, muttering: "Alright, two can play at that game."
_He takes out a piece of cloth, attempting to block the new leak. As he's preoccupied, a gust of wind blows away his toolbox, tools scattering everywhere._
Noah, chasing after them: "Oh, come on!"
_As he retrieves a wrench, he accidentally steps on a plank, creating yet another leak. Water shoots up, drenching him completely._
Noah, shouting at the sky: "Really? Really?!"
_An old man from the city stops by, holding an umbrella._
Old Man, chuckling: "You know, maybe it's a sign. Maybe you're just meant to be wet."
Noah, with mock cheerfulness: "Thanks for the insight. Really helpful."
Old Man, shrugging: "Just trying to offer some perspective. And maybe suggest a career change."
Noah, laughing despite himself: "Too late for that. I'm committed to this wet mess now."

_The scene fades with Noah, once again, climbing the ladder, his determination unwavering despite the continuous downpour and series of comedic misfortunes._
