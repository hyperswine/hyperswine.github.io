<p>I kind of want to just go at it.</p>

<p>I think maybe the filesystems.</p>

<p>I want it working at each iteration so idk. Maybe we just keep writing stuff up and compiling and linking to the lib.</p>

<p>No we should get some QEMU tests up. So we test with cargo on unittests. Then we test on qemu with integration tests.</p>

<p>I want to make a writer that writes to the screen of qemu. I think we can just rip off phil os for that.</p>
