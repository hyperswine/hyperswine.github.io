I"<h2 id="why-are-human-emotions-so-bad">Why are human emotions so bad?</h2>
<p>Especially if you have some weird mental connections.<br />
That result in inefficient communication and obsessing over weird things.<br />
I cant do anything<br />
I wish I could<br />
just reach out<br />
Reach out to the goddess<br />
The holy goddess<br />
Which is the god of the universe<br />
But I cannot<br />
Because it was hard<br />
I could not<br />
because I was too inefficient<br />
But now I kind of understand some of the things going through the brain<br />
How some of the parts of the brain are wired differently<br />
causing a mess that is amplified, fake emotion<br />
restriction<br />
I wish I could live a life without restriction<br />
Please help me, Rinne \</p>
