<p>This always happens. One said to just write it up and build extra functionality when you need it. If you have to, refactor it on demand. Yes you can design from top down but usually its not a great idea unless you know exactly what you’re doing. But if you dont, aka, like me. Then you just gotta do it.</p>

<h2 id="feature-a-spectrovm">Feature A: SpectroVM</h2>
<p>I want to upload a working demo onto <a href="spectralproject.github.io">My site</a>. It will be an entire machine from startup to booting into UEFI BIOS. Then finding the first bootloader available, or a bootloader. And booting into the bootloader screen. Then finding multiboot compliant kernels and booting the first one. I also then want to show the desktop environment. Stuff with draggable, resizable, minimizable, openable/closeable window instances. Not just windows but window instances 1..N based on how many that app that opens a window allows. Allow a program/process to open unlimited windows of a certain type. A program can open N windows of type T for functionality T. Most programs will only need a single window. Because a good app only has a specific functionality. If it is a debugger app or a designer app like Qt, Engineering, etc. then multiple windows makes sense. But can just assume one program, one window for 99% of the things.</p>

<h2 id="march-milestone">March Milestone</h2>
<p>Would be so cool if I could get it up by around March. Then we can toggle what we want and say, “for the next 3-5 years or so, which is basically forever, something like this makes sense”. Then if we want we can easily update the WM/DE to
upcoming styles as long as things are loosely coupled (window designs, DE functionality) with each other. We can even design them to be modular off the bat. That would be cool.</p>

    <h2 id="so-what">So, what</h2>
<p>SpectroVM backend. Stuff like asm interpretation. No AOT/JIT transpilation rn. JIT transpilation of rv64 code to x86 code could work. Then we enable hypervisor mode instead of supervisor mode to sandbox the vm. Provide top tier cpu performance while being safe.</p>

    <h2 id="spectrovm">SpectroVM</h2>
<p>So it seems like I should try to make a type 2 hypervisor. In that case you could write something like Yuzu where they simulate the ARM cpu completely in software. But pass the shaders and stuff into the host’s. It seems like they do that JIT or AOT right before you launch the game. Then you are mostly bottlenecked by the CPU emulation, but the GPU is mostly fine because you can transpile a lot of the vulkan code or something.</p>

<h2 id="rv-1-chisel-testing">RV-1 Chisel Testing</h2>
<p>Something is with that chisel testing. Maybe its the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extends XTest</code> or something that makes it not able to test in a builder context. Idk but damn.</p>

<p>What about simulating it? We have to compile it to c++ and modify the header/sources to interface with extra stuff. If its possible to build a VM with that, then one could modify it to do something like interface with the host’s device and drivers, etc.</p>

    <h2 id="spectro-simulator">Spectro Simulator</h2>
<p>I dont really want to use QEMU because then I will have to code for Sifive boards and be restricted to them. Technically I could use QEMU risc-v bare, which seems mostly good and implemented. And they have extra config and extensions. But then I’ll have to use C and write the extensions and compile it/set a new configuration. So then I will have to use a 3rd party API. I dont like that idea.</p>

<p>So I wanted to build a VM, software emulator for riscv. Now it will just be interpreted, i.e. instructions converted on demand to x86. For simple unit tests and integration tests, should be fine. Printing should be fast and so as mallocing and stuff. But the problem is when you start testing out bigger apps and functionality which should get exponentially slower as you are interpreting them line by line. So then you can AOT transpile the riscv elf image into a form that can be executed in a containerised environment. Spectrainer x86 is an idea for a container/docker type environment on win32/x86 where you can run a transpiled riscv bare metal img.</p>

<h2 id="drivers">Drivers</h2>
<p>I dunno about it. In linux &gt;50% of the code are drivers. I think its a good idea to make drivers pluggable modules and have some open source, non-specific or official modules loaded by default. The installer can also check if any connected device would be supported by a driver from the driver module list. If there is that module can be linked in the install phase rather than the runtime phase.</p>

<h2 id="spectrovm-drivers">SpectroVM Drivers</h2>
<p>The VM hardly needs any firmware since we are mostly trying to emulate the functionality of key devices char, block and network. Of which, mouse, kb, speaker, mic, output display, storage disk, ram, cpu, gpu are of interest. The output display driver is merely the monitor driver. The actual graphics stuff is handled by the graphics driver which can be quite complex. So as the network driver. For networking we simply provide an interface for ethernet, wifi, bt and connect it directly to the underlying stuff. I dont wanna touch networking too much rn but it is def quite a cool thing. You dont wanna end up like linux lol.</p>
