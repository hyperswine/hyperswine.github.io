# Short Formalism of Concurrency

Concurrency is a pretty damn good idea. What even is concurrency? Think about being able wait for one thing to finish while doing something else. Concurrency is basically just that. Several independent tasks are executing in overlapping time intervals. Parallelism actually implies concurrent execution, but not necessarily the other way around.

Is it possible to formalise concurrency in a way to analyse it more rigorously? Well, yea. People have already done so too.
