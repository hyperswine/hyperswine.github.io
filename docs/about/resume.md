# About Me - Jasen Qin

I am interested in a variety of computer-related technical subjects with years of experience in most popular software suites and development frameworks. I despise soulless work and wish to put all my best into creating a unique and outstanding product.

## Objectives

I wish to apply new and enlightened software concepts to the real world, and create working, reliable and user friendly applications. I am highly inspired to have the chance to execute real worlds projects on a wide range of computer science and software development related work and become more invested in what I enjoy doing.

I am available to offer technical support on a range of topics such as constructing and
maintaining computer systems and software, as well as technical admin support on a range of
software including NT, UNIX, most databases, and most full stack frameworks. I am also
free to be a private tutor for those wishing to learn the fundamentals of computer science,
mathematics, physics, chemistry and english.

## Education

UNSW (2019-Present)
