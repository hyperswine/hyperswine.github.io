# Nova

![Nova](/img/NOVA-FPGA.png)

Nova is a complete FPGA solution for all your simulation and verification needs. It includes boards and software (spectro), all free of charge.

## How does Nova work?

Nova is engineered to be an SoC simulator. It can be configured with 4-12 fpga ICs and up to 1MB SRAM and 8GB LPDDR6X. Includes extra ROM and USB ports if you really want. It is primarily programmed through the spectro protocol, which is a very simple and fast protocol that flashes a compiled HDL to the fpga ICs via USB.
