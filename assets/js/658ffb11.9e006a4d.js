Apparently it could be quite useful to modify the method definition at runtime if there's a bug or something. Maybe attach a remote debugger and tell the VM to change the object's method. Kind of like self modifying code as well I guess. It could be quite useful for security and pushing new features, but I have yet to see it in practice.

Combined with a very simple, resilient hardware system, it could be a very potent method of running programs."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Im also not quite sure about logic programming. On one hand, it seems quite powerful and concise in terms of representing classes of problems related to knowledge bases and queries. On the other hand, I dont really think its better than functional programming implementations like haskell at writing up complex logic for dealing with lists. I think an observation here is being able to easily express logic to deal with multi dimensional arrays. Python isnt too bad at it, but the syntax can be a bit confusing when people use ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"arr[1, 2]")," or when you have many dimensions and you have to keep track of what dimension it is in. Perhaps something like ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"rust-analyser")," could help here with its automatic annotations, which could be applied to tensor accesses statically or dynamically. Maybe something like an ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ith")," dimension, and the server is smart enough to detect a shortening of the dimensions for example to ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"i-1"),"."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,'Im not sure about proofs. It seems like you can pretty much prove everything, though the turing decidability problem is a limiting factor. So you could have something where you are able to prove 99% your functions terminate and even "statically" evaluate calls if they wont take up too much space. And decompose functions from a complex form to a simple form. Maybe through graph theory or HoTT. I heard its possible, through generating different, simpler functions and testing that against the original. Paired with randomised algorithms, the sky looks blue. Dependent types are also often talked about in proofs, and is a key component it seems, at least if you want static proofs. Theres total functional programming which actually seems quite good too, but if I will sacrifice expressiveness for it, then nevermind. It seems like the gist of most proof languages involve annotating down a function to ensure that the recursive case eventually reaches the base case through e.g. decrementing the required value at each step. There can not be any steps where you might or might not return a value, you must do so, and that value must get you strictly closer to your goal by some non-zero amount.'),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Verification is another thing. I haven't tried out a verification tool yet so I dont really know how to make of it. Some say its a waste of time.

I think I should look into it some more, but if your model or spec is flawed, wouldnt your software be too?"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Performance. Ive looked a bunch of articles and like... damn. Performance seems very hard to get right in the current software-hardware landscape. Whether that be through compiler optimisation, syscall optimisation, algorithmic optimisation, adding more potent hardware, faster and more memory, etc. On the compiler optimisation front, you have tons of ways to make a program potentially faster, often at the cost of more memory usage (time-space tradeoff). Sometimes though it could be as simple as removing redundant instructions and memory accesses, or batching them together. Maybe prefetching too, but tbh I haven't seen it been used myself, though I think LLVM should insert them (it goes against lazy evaluation though I think). I also dont even think high performance is that much of a problem. Rather its more like consistent, good enough performance. I would much rather play a game on a consistent 30 fps than having FPS spikes and valleys from 40-80fps even though the latter has a higher average fps. I also dont pay attention to variable resolution as long as its not too big of a gap, which means the flow of content is probably much more important than its sharpness or detail."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"To that end, on the consistent performance front, it might be good to start off with a lazy language and a deterministic set of hardware and low level interfaces.
