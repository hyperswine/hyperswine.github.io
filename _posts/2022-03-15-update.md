## Brain Perspectivisation of Surroundings

Perhaps a sense of claustrophobia? Or being stuck in a small place with hardly any view of the outside world.
Hence the only view is through the internet. Through other people. And you inherit their struggle.

It seems like a balancing process. Not too completely ignore them. But not to be completely stuck here.
The outside world, your place. Hurstville, Sydney, Australia. Why not move around a bit? And see that the shit you see online
is just that, shit.
