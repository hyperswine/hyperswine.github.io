## Making stuff

So yea i just wanna enjoy it. Idk if i should do it today. I'll just try out the circular saw. Idk about the band saw. I also need a few more bits of wood.

Loft bed -> can recycle old bed's frame. Problem is the mattress. Can prob use a memory foam on a soft wooden board. [Light Foam Mattress](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/392230455727). The wood board can be made from a bunch of smaller boards screwed onto the frame

Desk boards -> [Large boards here](https://www.bunnings.com.au/specrite-1200-x-300mm-18mm-timber-panel-golden-teak-acacia-fj-laminated-oiled_p8330188). Can also be used for cabinet boards. For the legs, just use those green ones. Useful to just put two of them next to each other

- just glue them together or even better, use a bracket on the bottom and drill them in. [Brackets that do just that](https://www.bunnings.com.au/carinya-140-x-125-x-3-5mm-galvanised-mending-plate-bracket-single_p3961589)

Open Cabinets -> cleaner, less material and less space. Again, the desk boards would be good here
