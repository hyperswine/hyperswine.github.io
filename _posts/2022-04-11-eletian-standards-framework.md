## Concept of Law

Law is important to set standards and principles that everyone should follow. And if they break those principles, corresponding consequences must be dealt to those responsible.

Noone is above the law.

### Common Law (British)

### Socialist Law (Russian)

Used in many socialist places.

### Islamic Law

## Policy

Policies are a more generalised version of law. They set the general principles that then form specific laws.
