## Sertraline

That stuff is the stuff. It kinda does stuff or something. Idk.
I think no caffeine basically. Except tea. But kinda hard to do when so negus'd outside with high wetness and discomfort.

So yea im not gonna do anything until like 15th or something. Technically March 11 was the deadline for the March Milestone on drivers and pi4b. But like lmao maybe I should just do rolling releases and prioritisation-practice instead of theory.
