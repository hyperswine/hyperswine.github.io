## I had a bit of a fit

Idk I just rage uninstalled some stuff. Esp the social stuff. Just so many people that obviously havent done their own research. Youtube, reddit, twitter. 4Chan is kinda meh depending on the anon and usually pretty unhelpful and comatose inducing with their liberal use of the n word.

## state library and jew museum

Heheh. Friday is done if I try. But I can still visit another one. Maybe art museum or something else.
Powerhouse museum I think.
