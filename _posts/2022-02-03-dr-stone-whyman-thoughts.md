title: Thoughts on Whyman, up to Z=227
---
## Analysis of Dr. Stone and Whyman

I want to come at this from a mostly rational perspective. This means,

1. I'll take assumptions much less seriously than actual evidence
2. "what is" takes more precedence than "what if"
3. I'll take certain tropes and features into account given that they are quite common
4. I'm all for metaphorical/allegorical explanations as long as they dont merely make a bunch of unfounded assumptions

## Whyman's Nature

- Whyman is an important plot element which drives the group to doing what they do, building a society that embraces scientific invention. Note this isnt the same as building a "scientifically literate" society. Dr. Stone does not have to be scientifically accurate, but based on science themes, e.g. Sci-Fi.

- Whyman was introduced around the middle, at Z=95. Before that, the group were mostly fighting local skirmishes and trying to survive the wild. I believe this a turning point of sorts, a way to show that the plot has progressed beyond "defeating nature" and onto "humanity". That being said perhaps Whyman is not the true end game boss, and more akin to someone with the importance of Tsukasa or Xeno & Stanely.
- The question of "Who is whyman" might be a way to mislead the reader from the true question being asked. Whyman is only mentioned a few times and not that significant of a character for the most part of the plot. He exists more as a concept. As a way to ascribe any "overall blame" to, a way to scapegoat anything that seems out of the realm of science. As a character, he is mentioned 14 times in 12 chapters.
- So I dont think whyman is a character in the group or any human character. So theories like "Albert Einstein" or "<Character that just so happens to explain Whyman's actions>" isnt something I like, but will go through anyway.

# Whyman = Luna?

Out of all the characters, there is one that catches my attention. There are many coincidences for Luna and Whyman's equivalence.

- Luna means moon in latin. Given that whyman's signal originates from there and the symbolism of the moon as a rock ("stone") may be relevant
- She is an american scientist and seemingly quite intelligent
- She is quite infatuated with Senku, though Senku only thinks of their relationship for political gain. Perhaps she's doing this to motivate Senku to reach his dreams or something similar
- Her complete history remains hidden and maybe she has some hidden potential or something that enables her to emulate Whyman that we simply weren't introduced to yet
- Her birthdate is on the release date of Z=227 (a day off, but close). Maybe theres some symbolic meaning that Kiichiro wanted us to link together

So Luna is someone that seems quite capable and someone who wants to be with an intelligent person of her desires. Not much else is shown about her and perhaps she has other motivations that we do not know of. Perhaps she has done something in the past that was not clearly given to the reader or was hinted at. I have to look more into it.

## Why I dont think think Luna is Whyman

- Coincidences are coincidences. There are many coincidences and Riichiro may have just tried to think of names that fit a certain theme, in this case Science, rocketry, etc.
- We heard her internal monologue. As many others have noted, Riichiro decided to show us many of the character's deepest thoughts and feelings. Given this, it seems Luna is more of a side character whose purpose is to bridge the gap between Senku and the Americans.
- Being smart is one thing, being able to send out messages from the moon is another. Perhaps she could have used the signal reflection or some tricks to appear like the messages came from the moon. But that is still quite far off the evidence being presented and also doesnt explain why she did so at Z=95 when Whyman's signal was first introduced. Maybe she was simply testing the apparatus? Again no real evidence to support this.

Basically, a bunch of coincidences and "what ifs", but not enough physical evidence to suggest that she was the one behind it. Nor anything substantial to suggest she had anything to do with Whyman, e.g. an accomplice.

# Whyman = Human?

Maybe Whyman is Kaseki, Chrome, Tsukasa, Xeno, or maybe Senku himself?

- Each character has their own personal motivations, maybe some have a secret motivation to puppet the events of the series
- Some characters like Xeno and Senku are quite smart and may be able to do some trickery like sending Whyman's messages. Could be some elaborate explanation behind it that makes sense

## Senku

- His motivations are quite clear. As the main character, he seeks to rebuild society and progress science.
- If it was him, then a lot of what he and the group has gone through would just be simply pushed aside. Some retconning will probably be needed to make this work well without just feeling kind of cheap and a sense of "...really? it was senku?".
- I guess maybe if he was an amnesiac or simply just removed his memory of what had happened or something, then maybe. But again that just feels kind of cheap and there is no evidence to suggest he would have done so. Before the stoning he was simply a science enthuasist like Xeno, playing around with chemicals in the school labs. He was interested in rockets and made use of his work for his friends and for fun.

## Xeno

- A man of science and reason. The apex of scientific prowess and one who wishes to bring such to everyone. Seeks to create a world that upholds rational thought and rule over the unenlightened masses.
- Would have motivation to cause the great stoning or the production of medusas. But if he did, then I think he should be quite a bit more ahead than presented to us. He only just implemented the Haber process and did not know how to undo the stoning. He desperately seeked the formula from a rag tag group of people while he had machine guns and planes.
- After a bunch of fighting and character development, it seems clear that Xeno is simply obssessed with science as a concept and merely wants to take advantage of the situation to create a world of his liking. He does not seem like a person who would orchestrate something like the stoning or the medusas however.

## Why I dont think any of them are Whyman

- As with luna, we have seen most of the "suspcious" characters' internal monologues. With someone like Xeno, we know some stuff about their past and their motivations in creating a kingdom only for X where X is either the strong, the rational, etc.
- That being said, I think the current characters would be way too cheap as a secret Whyman. Unless some elaborate and hidden plot point was to be construed. It just would not have enough 'effect' to make a human character Whyman

## Though

It might be interesting though, to have Whyman as a "runner up villain" to the true final boss. Then whyman could possibly be someone from the group or literally Einstein's preserved brain that just wants to help humanity out or something.

Whyman would be less of an interesting character then, and the secret final boss would be pushed further into the plot.

# Whyman = Feat of technology?

Maybe Whyman is a superintelligent AI, a swarm of nanobots, a time travesome kind of out of control machination?

- As a series, Dr Stone has always been about inventing useful tools to assist humanity. Technology is the prime plot element that allows the group to make progress and be successful in their endeavours.

## AI?

- Maybe some rogue AI invented in the modern day went out of control, made itself onto the moon and carried out its misled goal of saving humanity. It would have both the intelligence and motivation to do as such.
- But I mean, it would seem kind of obvious and no mention of it was ever made in the series. The closest thing to it would be a computer capable of doing basic arithmetic. Also feels kind of cheap.
- But I do think it is viable, just not something I would personally like. Maybe the AI could be instead portrayed as a manifestation of human desires, kind of like an [egregore](https://theosophy.wiki/en/Egregore) born from the deepest, darkest human desires to be safe and happy. And the AI decided being stoned would be a way to achieve that end.

## Nanomachines, Son

- Im no expert on nanotechnology but apparently a swarm of nanobots can do some truly miraculous things. Although such feats are not yet possible in our world, it is within the realm of a decade's science.

- Perhaps someone like Xeno invented nanobots, and they happened to go out of control. Then they caused the great stoning and the events of the series, somehow by way of science. Things like the medusa could be explainable by nanobot manipulation of the surrounding environment. Living things would be covered in nanobots, which may inject the host with something to keep them alive. This would explain why some were still fully conscious. The fact that the stone itself seems to be made of some limestone substance could mean the nanobots harden and decompose to limestone.
- They are small enough to not be easily detectable. Even with microscopes. You would need an electron microscope because they are on the order of nanometres. Them moving about could be pretty inconspicuous too. Like ants they could move themselves in columns on any surface and go anywhere they wanted.
- They could be around humanity all this time but only revealed themselves as a large swarm on the moon. Maybe they wanted to show humanity their true form. Maybe they wanted to show humans what they're capable of and desired to be a "pet" or to be loved to humans. Like how a dog may do things it thinks its owner wants to please them and for their owners to accept them.
- Evidence is still a bit far for this one. Nanobots are a feat of science but not something heavily suggested anywhere in the series. I think they would be made a bit more obvious. Though still viable as something that can be introduced at Z=228.

## Mecha Senku

- Maybe its some clone of Senku or someone special like Einstein. They would be intelligent and motivated to do something like the great stoning.
- They could have gone to the moon or made themselves appear like they are on the moon.

- But there is literally no evidence or anything in the mainline series to suggest this in any serious way.
- If it was then the great stoning must have stoned Kiichiro himself.

## Something else, maybe an elaborate device or environment that can produce medusas?

- Medusas all look the same and function identically. Perhaps they could be mass produced on an assembly line in a factory of some sorts. The factory could be run autonomously like an Amazon Warehouse. The exclamation at the end of Z=227 maybe a way to say that the concept of mass production, invention, science has been with us all along.

- Medusas also have a lifecycle. You use it too much and its battery runs out. If it was some magical device, then it would seem rather weird, why not just give it infinite potential? But it is a device that requires a human operator, specifically voice controlled. It also needs a specific set of commands, <x metres, x seconds> and not just "abracadabra" or "stone them". So I think the medusa is most likely a product of science, an invention made by someone or something.

So I think if Kiichiro wanted the medusa to be some magical item, he would have made it more obvious. But instead we are given a glimpse of its inner workings with a microscope (Joel) and see that it has embedded circuitry and physical characteristics consistent with some photoelectronic device like a camera.

If the Medusa was a mass produced item, its factory could look something like the <strong>[Sibyl System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyQpY6UWs2E)</strong> or an <strong>[Amazon Warehouse](https://youtu.be/IMPbKVb8y8s?t=221)</strong>. Such a thing could be hidden on Earth or on the Moon without anyone noticing and be the products (medusas) can delivered to any location via drones. I like the idea of something like the Sibyl System where a bunch of human brains or swarm of AI intelligence manage the medusas production and plan ahead to see what will happen. Perhaps its like a corporation which cares about its stock value and forecasts, so its actions may reflect that.

# Whyman = Metaphysical entity?

Perhaps whyman isnt someone obvious, but rather an entity that exists in concept that everyone knows about? Perhaps Whyman is god himself, a curious alien, some kind of interdimensional phenomenon like a time traveller?

- When we ascribe something like the great stoning of 3700 years ago to something that exists out of the realm of physical reality, we can literally make anything up.
- Maybe Kiichiro wanted to teach us a 'lesson' or an allegory about the evolution of humanity and human nature. Perhaps the great stoning is analogous to the asteroid that wiped the dinosaurs or some kind of global disaster that forces humanity to be uncomfortable and therefore adapt and innovate.

## Aliens, duh

As a fan of the history channel, I have learnt that the cause behind everything is a singular entity known as "Aliens". Apparently this entity was behind everything, the pyramids, atlantis, why I ate 3 eggs this morning instead of 2. Whenever you have trouble explaning anything, just remember, Aliens.

- I mean it is technically possible. There is hardly any evidence if at all to support extraterrorestrial involvement anywhere in the series, but if it was Aliens, you bet they could and prob would do something like this.
- There could be a bunch of reasons. Maybe they thought in lines of a savior, trying to prevent humans from killing themselves in a nuclear war which they envisioned. Maybe they simply didnt like humans. Maybe they did it on accident. Maybe a few friends from a galaxy nearby flew to Earth and played around with their new toy, and accidentally caused the great stoning. Then they left behind the medusas and quickly escaped the crime scene.
- Or maybe its actually past humans that went to space millions of years ago and reached the Dark side of the moon. Maybe they built underground bases on the moon and evolved into something alien like. They made medusas and did the whole thing for whatever reason suits them, I guess.

Yeah I dont really know about this one. Its possible for sure but unless Kiichiro made this series as a joke, I dont think the ending will simply be "ayy lmao". If Whyman wasnt the endgame boss though, I guess anything could happen. Aliens could fit into that realm of viability.

## Some interdimensional entity or Time Traveller

- If they had such ability, then they should be able to pull off something like the great stoning or produce medusas in a non-obvious manner.
- They wouldnt be too out of the ream of science. Time travel into the future is certainly possible with high speeds and Time travel into the past could be done via manipulation of spacetime or exploiting a phenomenon like black holes, dark energy, etc. that we dont fully understand.
- There are 11 dimensions in the String Theory and perhaps it is possible to exist in 5,6,7..11 dimensions and therefore not be obvious to humans living in 3 dimensions. They could certainly be "closer then we thought" but simply unreachable since they exist in within $D^5$ or something.
- These entities may be curious about their new toy, i.e. the medusa and tested it on humans. Like ants and animals that humans test their treatments on. Perhaps they do see it as a treatment and wanted evidence of it working on humans before using it on themselves.

## Biblical Connotations

- Dr. Stone reads kind of the like the holy books in Abrahamic Religions. At first there was God, a transcendental entity, then the creation of the Earth, skies, life. Then came Adam and Eve, knowledge of good and evil and their lineage. We reach certain points, Abraham, Moses, David, etc. where conflict between human tribes/beliefs/philosophies happen. Then we reach some point where a prophet/messiah (Jesus/Muhammad) comes down and saves humanity.
- So we start at the end, where civilisation is doomed from the great stoning (Judgement day). Then a certain group of characters in space are the only ones alive (Noah's Ark). The people of the Ark descend to Earth and begin anew, saving the human lineage by breeding with each other.
- Eventually they develop into a small civilisation. Then Senku (the messiah) is born a virgin birth (from stone). He seemingly comes out of nowhere and saves the tribe from illness and other people.
- Things happen and Senku leads the group across treacherous territories and are tempted by Satan (Xeno) to give into the magnificence of science and take advantage of the unenlightened masses. But Senku stays on course and his disciples (chrome, kaseki, etc) stay loyal to him.
- Senku ascends to the heavens on a winged horse (rocket) to meet God (Whyman). He wishes to be blessed with divine knowledge (knowledge of the medusa and Whyman himself) and his accomplices (notice how he has 2 accomplices, at least at first) go with him.

So you kind of have a circular view of history where the Messiah returns after catastrophe, and he starts to save everyone. Then the messiah goes along with his quest yet again until the next judgement day comes. Senku could be crucified (petrified) again along with everyone else until the cycle inevitably repeats itself.

Perhaps also the stoning itself is meant to represent the humanity deterring from God's lessons. Perhaps humans have broken the covenant between them and God by trying to reach god (building a rocket to go to space/moon). Like the tower of Babel, perhaps Whyman did not like how humans were trying to reach its level and "punished" humans by petrifing them. The tower (science and civilisation) was crumbled and the people reverted back to their primitive, fearful forms.

# Whyman = Not a person, Not a thing, But a concept. Maybe the something to do with the nature of the Moon and Life?

So here's a philosophical take on Whyman's identity.

Perhaps whyman is a manifestation of human desires that seeks to treat humans of their "illness" of being fragile and their desire to recieve quick and simple answers.

# My Hypothesis: Whyman is the indeed the endgame boss and a manifestation of Human desires that involves the Moon, Humanity and Science

That means Whyman can still be a physical thing, like a person or device. But I believe his physical identity is less meaningful than what he represents.
