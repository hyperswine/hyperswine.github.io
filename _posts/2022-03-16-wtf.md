title: This Game Though

## I hate this game

When you have a brain like mine. When you want to change the world. When you are short and dumb at least in the past which got a lotta laughter.

When you are edgy. Lol. Idk I just kinda want some stability. I dont want war or persecution. But I have a strong persecution complex that fits in with my inferiority complex and brain. I wish I could just live a kinda normal life. I like some of the people before me. Leonardo, Greek guys, alhazen, Ben. Idk maybe I dont have to go out of my way to change the world or lead people.

I do want to come up with ideas and stuff that could help. Yeah like many before me. I dont see why anyone would come after me but... Idk. I guess I just really want certainty.

I'll go out to the library again today, just for an hour or so maybe. Since its sports day its not too bad I think. But after 12.
