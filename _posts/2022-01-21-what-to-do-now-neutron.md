## What to do now?

I kind of want to just go at it.

I think maybe the filesystems.

I want it working at each iteration so idk. Maybe we just keep writing stuff up and compiling and linking to the lib.

No we should get some QEMU tests up. So we test with cargo on unittests. Then we test on qemu with integration tests.

I want to make a writer that writes to the screen of qemu. I think we can just rip off phil os for that.
