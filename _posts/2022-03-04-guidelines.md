# Guidelines

## What are guidelines

In the new world, there is no 'law', rather there are guidelines

# Constitution of Eleryia

Sections:

1. All citizens of Eleryia must be granted a fair chance at life.
2. All citizens of Eleryia must undergo continual enlightenment on their own terms. An unenlightened society will be punished by its own sin and destroy itself from within.
3. A separate, neutral body must manage the enlightenment within the people. They are responsible for cross validation of claims and ideas and are the philosophical spokespeople of the Court of Consequences.
4. The Court of Consequences succeeds law. It is imperative to judge fairly and critically at the exact moment when an action was taken and its consequences based wholly on the moral and practical context.
5. The infinite value of a human life must be upheld from early to end. From the end, the brain is filled with sin and shall not be allowed to participate in social affairs.
6. Humanity's covenant with the Goddess must be kept unless the people wish to drown in their own sin.
