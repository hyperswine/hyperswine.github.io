## I want to go check out the jewish history museum

I might go tommorow or something. I wish to see evidence of jewish persecution from the ancient middle east, to classical rome, medieval europe to the present.

Is there evidence for Abraham? As the ancestor of the jews and arabs, it would certainly be something.
