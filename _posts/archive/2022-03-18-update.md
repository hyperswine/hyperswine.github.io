## Jew Museum not open today

Damn. Well they are open on sunday though.

## Brain = done?

Damn I think my brain is done. I just am too retarded to do anything cool.
After months of getting gaslit by my own insides. I want to go out maybe later though.
At I would say 4 or something. IDK.

## Stuff

I wanna look at drivers and ACPI interface tables for devices. I want to get an idea of how to drive a QEMU device when mmio is setup and hotplug is setup.

Then I wanna look at some cool science stuff. Maybe rocketry, optics, engineering, aerospace. Maybe additive manufacturing of a rocket with blender.

You see its not that these things are "hard" its just that you need the thing to be there. A feeling of "wow".

When we want to paint, we want to relax. But it is hard to do so. Just because if you want to paint something good, then idk??
