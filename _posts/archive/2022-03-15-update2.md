## The last post didnt show

Idk why. Prob something to do on their end.

## Stomach aches

damn food. I think it has something to do with chicken. Maybe also exacerbated by carbonated liquids which screw up the stomach.

I also noticed a thing with eating a lotta carbs. I think they digest more slowly or something. And since I dont usually go out and stuff to do 15-15 aerobic exercise, idk.

Best diet is once again, few eggs with pork or beef. And lotta greens like peas and lettuce. Maybe spinach, well at least the water spinach.
