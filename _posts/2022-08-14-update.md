## Arcen

So yea an arcen file is an rx file. An rx file looks like:

```rust
use super::*;

fn use_state<T>(t: T) {
    static mut storage = t;
}

// gets parsed as a functional component
pub fn Component() -> Element {
    let x = use_state(true);

    return @{
        Box {}
    }
}

struct Props {
    color: String
    // or
    // color: Rc<&str>
}

#[component]
pub fn Component(props: Props) {
    return @{
        Box {}
    }
}

// TRANSFORMED TO in proc-macro
pub fn Component() -> Element {
    return @{
        Box {}
    }
}

// TRANSFORMED TO in build.rs
pub fn Component() -> Element {
    return @{
        Box {}
    }
}

// index.rx
pub fn Index() -> Element {
    let animate = Animate {duration: 10};

    @{
        Heading {}
        Box {
            Quote {}
            Flex {}
            Link(to="component") {
                Text {"CLICK ME"}
            }
            Flex(animate={animate}) {}
        }
    }
}
```

## RX-Analyzer

I want to parse an rx file. But I dont really want to parse the rust part of it. Actually I just want to expand the rx parts into rust. Then pass that as a rust string to rust-analyzer. Then somehow get it to work together. Like maybe have rust-analyzer analyse the generated rust and pass that to rx-analyzer. Which then passes the results to the IDE.

I saw `rust-analyzer/editors/code` and it contributes quite a lot of features. Like wow. Maybe some of them are implicit, whenever you do things with cargo, add new code, etc. Some of them are like run tests, run main, debug, as well. Some of the cargo integration involves cargo check and cargo build in the background when you add new deps or use them maybe.

Its good exp in the code itself. Where you have extra annotations of arg types passed into a function, whether the fn even exists, etc. Whether an item has been used and whether it is non-trivial. As in everything that is used gets passed in and "used" either by ownership or borrow.

Hmm...

What if, I try it out. Yea nothing to lose. Build rust-analyzer with rx-analyzer. Or somehow use rust-analyzer within rx-analyzer? Yea that would be a better idea.
