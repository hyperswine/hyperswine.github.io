## Arcen

So yea an arcen file is an rx file. An rx file looks like:

```rust
use super::*;

fn use_state<T>(t: T) {
    static mut storage = t;
}

// gets parsed as a functional component
pub fn Component() -> Element {
    let x = use_state(true);

    return @{
        Box {}
    }
}

struct Props {
    color: String
    // or
    // color: Rc<&str>
}

#[component]
pub fn ComponentP(Props {named_prop}: Props) {
    return @{
        Box {
            named_prop
        }
    }
}

// TRANSFORMED TO in proc-macro
pub fn Component() -> Element {
    return @{
        Box {}
    }
}

// TRANSFORMED TO in build.rs
pub fn Component() -> Element {
    // variables defined in a  function should be captured by closures
    // and are auto captured by rx blocks
    let x = Iter::<i32>::new();

    // maybe create an Arc<>
    let handle_click = || {}

    // syntax 1
    return @{
        Box {
            // returns Vec<Element>
            x.map_to_vec(|g| 
                Flex {
                    // g must implement ToString as it basically gets converted into a Text::new(g.to_string())
                    g,
                    Box {}
                }
            )
        }
        // all strings are converted to String after expansion for ease of passing
        ComponentP(named_prop="hello", on_click=handle_click) {

        }
    }
}

/*
    RESERVED:
    h, w, p => (pl, pr, pt, pb)
    m => (ml, mr, mt, mb)
    background_color
    color
    animate
*/

/*
    Box::new(vec![])

    // either returns an Element or a vec of elements
    // which are then "stitched" together with .push()/.append()
*/

// how to use strings?
// use s: &str = "s"
// or s = String::from("s")

// index.rx
pub fn Index() -> Element {
    let animate = Animate {duration: 10};

    @{
        Heading {}
        Box {
            Quote {}
            Flex {}
            Link(to="component") {
                Text {"CLICK ME"}
            }
            Flex(animate={animate}) {}
        }
    }
}
```

## RX-Analyzer

I want to parse an rx file. But I dont really want to parse the rust part of it. Actually I just want to expand the rx parts into rust. Then pass that as a rust string to rust-analyzer. Then somehow get it to work together. Like maybe have rust-analyzer analyse the generated rust and pass that to rx-analyzer. Which then passes the results to the IDE.

I saw `rust-analyzer/editors/code` and it contributes quite a lot of features. Like wow. Maybe some of them are implicit, whenever you do things with cargo, add new code, etc. Some of them are like run tests, run main, debug, as well. Some of the cargo integration involves cargo check and cargo build in the background when you add new deps or use them maybe.

Its good exp in the code itself. Where you have extra annotations of arg types passed into a function, whether the fn even exists, etc. Whether an item has been used and whether it is non-trivial. As in everything that is used gets passed in and "used" either by ownership or borrow.

Hmm...

What if, I try it out. Yea nothing to lose. Build rust-analyzer with rx-analyzer. Or somehow use rust-analyzer within rx-analyzer? Yea that would be a better idea.

We need cargo integration to get the definitions of a component. Components must be defined in .rx files as function components. Props should use dynamically allocated structures like `Box<T>` and String. A prop should be parsed as a rust struct like normal. And can be imported from normal rust contexts.

## SwiftUI

I like swift ui, but uhh. It uses functional component arch. Which isnt bad, and means you can add/remove thigns easily. And possibly format the stuff more efficiently. BUt you will get much longer lines. Which I dont like. React makes it so your props are all within the tag. Which I do like.

So I think QML is the "best" idea rn. So QML but with more react like semantics. Where your XML is embedded within a more rust like environment. Maybe `rx-analyzer` can do cargo check as well beforehand. To allow `.rs` files to contain XML.

## epaint

So the guy who maintained egui actually made a library for converting 2D shapes into vertex specs/quads and stuff. This is very, very good. With our box model, it just works then.
