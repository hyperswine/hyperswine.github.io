## Getting somewhere?

I feel like Im getting somewhere. I dont have amazing drivers at least just yet. Or even keyboard input. But for the `virt` machine the rust one may work. Otherwise it shouldnt be too bad. Mouse as well. I think I should just code them from first principles.

Its great just saying stuff out loud. It really helps the brain from suiciding. I wont talk about stuff later on like April. But March is in sight.

## March Milestone

I wanted to get some more drivers up. And key services that use those drivers. Including reading and writing to disk, formatting on btrfs. And loading and executing an ELF64 binary for neutron/riscv64. For assets, I think I can just use bootstrap icons. Either rip em directly since their GPL and credit them.

For creative animations though, thats another thing. I can use adobe animate for simple 2D stuff or even just blender. But idk its also kinda annoying to do well. I think affinity designer + blender would be the best idea for simple, circuit, quantum, atomic inspired animations. With low color saturation. Orange and black. And mostly rounded, no sharp corners.
