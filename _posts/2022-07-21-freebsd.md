## Init Main

So freebsd calls `mi_startup` as its first common entry point it seems, at `sys/kern/init_main.c`. Before that, it may be booted from something like GRUB or simply an EFI stub. I think it might also have an MBR stub too.

There, it does a few things. I noticed the first thing it does is to declare pointers to `sysinit` structs. Some double pointers. I think those are meant to be system init tasks, some of which are tabulated. A lot of it is traversing through the sysinit tables' primary and secondary keys (SQL like?), and sorting them, then calling `(*((*sipp)->func))((*sipp)->udata);` to initialise that system. Its done in this manner to make it easy to plug and play a subsystem like the VMM or cpu. And maybe allow dynamic loading of arch dependent subsystems.

`sysinit` is just:

```c
struct sysinit {
 void (*func) (void *arg);
 void *data;
};
```

So a function pointer that takes in some unformatted arg. And a piece of data. The actual data looks like `sysinit_data`, which is a struct containing the filename, debug info, msb, lsb, etc. Of a certain value (in a config file?). `SYSINT()` is called in many places, presumably to start each core subsystem.

## Memory Management

There is arch dependent and arch independent code for it. Normally all arches have a hardware MMU with a set of common page attributes. Like dirty, paged on disk, protected, ro, rdwrite, executable.
