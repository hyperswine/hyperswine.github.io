## Summary

The roman cycle -> one invents, rises to greatness, then is destroyed from within. Another picks up from thereon, rises to greatness, and is destroyed from within.

The zerubabel effect -> create, destroy, create and so on.

### True Freedom

A sense that one is truly free to make their own decisions. To live their own ways. Within certain boundaries determined by the nature of the universe.

- Not like now, where noone is free

### Permanent Progress

Continual, everlasting progression of culture and technology. Allowing individuals to more effectively and efficiently manipulate spacetime.

Ultimate goal => Truly understand the nature of the universe and become the master of it. </br></br>

## Design

### First Principles

Loose coupling -> easily upgrades when needed.

KISS -> each atomic component should be as simple and straightforward as possible. Complexity is built through layers and relationships between simpler components. Each component should have a primary idea for its level and a single responsibility for that level. </br></br>

## Implementation Tools

### PHANTA REI

- **Rei** -> a systems an app level language.
- **Prei** (Package Rei) -> a strong package manager and auto config/build system that uses high level prei syntax.
- **Phanta** -> a modular, NLP based scripting and Object oriented prototyping system. Mainly for incorporating into rei based projects.

### Umbral Suite & Fabricator IDE

- **Editor** -> includes syntax highlighting and autoamtic annotations and macros and expansions akin to rust, ts-react, clion and intelliJ
- **FFX Layouter** -> akin to Qt Designer or Android Studio XML.
Git Wrapper Builtin -> builtin to the IDE, a high level git wrapper using reiversion.
- **Documenter Builtin** -> akin to zeal when you hover over a specific identifier or keyword. Like rust-analyzer as well with error squiggles and unused lines. Renders reidoc double slash comments on the fly.
- **Umbral Database** -> great Key-Value boosted (in RAM) database that is written to the disk (backup) but CPU-Cache Explotative and RAM-first. Good for high CPU cache server CPUs.

### Runtime & Environment

- **Neutron Quanta** -> Kernel/OS User Environment that is optimised for rei and quick iterations/hot reload programming (HRP), basically like flutter + vscode.
- **Reii** (Rei Interpreter) -> like node or python interpreters. Allows line by line/statement by statement interpretation when using a notebook or terminal and JIT for HRP. Allows us to run rei scripts easily to manage certain things in the environment, build systems like prei, intervaled scripts (IVS).
- **Ardaku DE** -> Highest Level GUI environment for Quanta based on NeutronWM, akin to Wayland bus architecture.

### Hardware

- **Neuromorph I** -> A neuromorphic chip that stores a large neural network (digraph nodes with weighted edges). Can be easily trained directly via writing the inputs to the Driver/MMIO
- **Server CPU** -> A high performance Server CPU with 128 Cores, superscalar (no VLIW), high cache for all levels. For highly parallel requests (mostly reads), since writes only need DMA from RAM to Neuromorph I's NRAM

### Possible Improvements

- **Quanta I** -> A quantum chip with many qcores. Can be used for high performance, low level simulations. High level simulations also possible. Useful for all kinds of forecasting, but for human use rather than internal machine use
