## So a submarine...
A really cool thing. You can dive up to hundreds of metres and stay for a long time. I think the deepest was like 10km, a special sub for the mariana trench.
So you have horizontal stabiliers or 'fins' that change the angle of attack. When you dive you want a low AOT to more efficiently cut through the water as the ballast fills. When you rotate the fins counterclockwise (to the front), the flow of water is greater at the top than at the bottom, forcing the submarine down even more. When you rotate it clockwise, it does the opposite and the flow of water is greater at the bottom of the fin, pushing the vessel up. Pushing the water out of the ballast will then further add to its buoyancy as it becomes less dense and speedily charges upwards.
