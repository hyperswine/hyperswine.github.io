## This is a Heading

Hi! This is a message

## This is some code

You can have code elements like `this`. Or ```this```. If you want centered code:

{% highlight js %}
// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");
adder(2, 6);
{% endhighlight %}
