## Command Buffers

Command buffers are the primary way of telling the GPU what you want it to do. Like the VC4, you wouldnt directly set the regs and branches, but you would instead have a queue of high-ish level instructions, that are prob subject to out of order execution as well. So there is fencing for command buffers.

For amdgpu, you have a PCIe device, which prob uses at least 4 lanes, and up to 16 lanes. Most of the time you are DMAing 4K at a time back and forth, subject to queues and buffering along hardware and software both ways.

The lowest level software portion of the kernel driver prob involves invoking the PCIe driver.

## PCI Devices

So PCI devices replace the older ISA standard. It allows better performance of data transfer, platform independence, simpler interface for adding and removing peripherals. Peripherals like headphones plugged into an audio jack, which is prob connected to a PCI audio converter device.

A motherboard's firmware prob has to be pretty coupled to its original set of PCI ports.
