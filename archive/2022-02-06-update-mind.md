## Why my mind sucks

Apparently theres some inefficient connections between specific sets of neurons in the frontal lobe. Something about the connections being a bit messy between the left and right hemispheres.

As a result I am like this. An idiot. Yes, it is what it is. I hate it. Well Idk at least I know I wont be dying like a slave like everyone else. Imagine slaving away.

Slaving away for eternity. 40 years. Then another 40 years of boredom and uselessness. You dont do anything. Nothing new. You dont discover new things. You dont invent. You are just a shell.

Thats the fate of a lot of people. It is sad indeed.
I dont want to be like that.
